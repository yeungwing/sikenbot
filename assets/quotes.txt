Tell me about the dream where we pull the bodies out of the lake
and dress them in warm clothes again.
How it was late, and no one could sleep, the horses running
until they forget that they are horses.

---

It's not like a tree where the roots have to end somewhere,
it's more like a song on a policeman's radio,
how we rolled up the carpet so we could dance, and the days
were bright red, and every time we kissed there was another apple
to slice into pieces.

---

Look at the light through the windowpane. That means it's noon, that means
we're inconsolable.
Tell me how all this, and love too, will ruin us.
These, our bodies, possessed by light.
Tell me we'll never get used to it.

---

There are so many things I'm not allowed to tell you.
I touch myself, I dream.
Wearing your clothes or standing in the shower for over an hour, pretending
that this skin is your skin, these hands your hands,
these shins, these soapy flanks.

---

The musicians start the overture while I hide behind the microphone,
trying to match the dubbing
to the big lips shining down from the screen.

---

We're filming the movie called Planet of Love-
there's sex of course, and ballroom dancing,
fancy clothes and waterlilies in the pond, and half the night you're
a dependable chap, mounting the stairs in lamplight to the bath

---

but then the too white teeth all night,
all over the American sky, too much to bear, this constant fingering,
your hands a river gesture, the birds in flight, the birds still singing
outside the greasy window, in the trees.

---

There's a part in the movie
where you can see right through the acting,
where you can tell that I'm about to burst into tears,
right before I burst into tears
and flee to the slimy moonlit riverbed
canopied with devastated clouds.

---

We're shooting the scene where I swallow your heart and you make me
spit it up again. I swallow your heart and it crawls
right out of my mouth.
You swallow my heart and flee, but I want it back now, baby. I want it back.

---

Lying on the sofa with my eyes closed, I didn't want to see it this way,
everything eating everything in the end.
We know how the light works,
we know where the sound is coming from.
Verse. Chorus. Verse.
I'm sorry. We know how it works. The world is no longer mysterious.

---

The radio aches a little tune that tells the story of what the night
is thinking. It’s thinking of love.
It’s thinking of stabbing us to death
and leaving our bodies in a dumpster.

---

Tonight, by the freeway, a man eating fruit pie with a buckknife
carves the likeness of his lover’s face into the motel wall. I like him
and I want to be like him, my hands no longer an afterthought.

---

Someone once told me that explaining is an admission of failure.
I’m sure you remember, I was on the phone with you, sweetheart.

---

History repeats itself. Somebody says this.
History throws its shadow over the beginning, over the desktop,
over the sock drawer with its socks, its hidden letters.
History is a little man in a brown suit
trying to define a room he is outside of.

---

History is a little man in a brown suit
trying to define a room he is outside of.
I know history. There are many names in history
but none of them are ours.

---

He had green eyes,
so I wanted to sleep with him—
green eyes flecked with yellow, dried leaves on the surface of a pool-
You could drown in those eyes, I said.

---

The fact of his pulse,
the way he pulled his body in, out of shyness or shame or a desire
not to disturb the air around him.
Everyone could see the way his muscles worked,
the way we look like animals,
his skin barely keeping him inside.

---

I wanted to take him home
and rough him up and get my hands inside him, drive my body into his
like a crash test car.
I wanted to be wanted and he was
very beautiful, kissed with his eyes closed, and only felt good while moving.

---

You could drown in those eyes, I said,
so it’s summer, so it’s suicide,
so we’re helpless in sleep and struggling at the bottom of the pool.

---

It wasn’t until we were well past the middle of it
that we realized
the old dull pain, whose stitched wrists and clammy fingers,
far from being subverted,
had only slipped underneath us, freshly scrubbed.

---

Mirrors and shop windows returned our faces to us,
replete with the tight lips and the eyes that remained eyes
and not the doorways we had hoped for.

---

His wounds healed, the skin a bit thicker than before,
scars like train tracks on his arms and on his body underneath his shirt.

---

We still groped for each other on the backstairs or in parked cars
as the roads around us
grew glossy with ice and our breath softened the view through a glass
already laced with frost,
but more frequently I was finding myself sleepless, and he was running out
of lullabies.

---

but more frequently I was finding myself sleepless, and he was running out
of lullabies.

---

But damn if there isn’t anything sexier
than a slender boy with a handgun,
a fast car, a bottle of pills.

---

What would you like? I’d like my money’s worth.
Try explaining a life bundled with episodes of this—
swallowing mud, swallowing glass, the smell of blood
on the first four knuckles.

---

We pull our boots on with both hands
but we can’t punch ourselves awake and all I can do
is stand on the curb and say Sorry
about the blood in your mouth. I wish it was mine.

---

Sorry about the blood in your mouth. I wish it was mine.

---

I couldn’t get the boy to kill me, but I wore his jacket for the longest time.

---

I take off my hands and I give them to you but you don't
want them, so I take them back
and put them on the wrong way, the wrong wrists.

---

The yard is dark, the tomatoes are next to the whitewashed wall,
the book on the table is about Spain,
the windows are painted shut.

---

Tonight you're thinking of cities under crowns
of snow and I stare at you like I'm looking through a window,
counting birds.

---

You wanted happiness, I can't blame you for that,
and maybe a mouth sounds idiotic when it blathers on about joy but tell me
you love this, tell me you're not miserable.

---

You do the math, you expect the trouble.
The seaside town. The electric fence.

---

Draw a circle with a piece of chalk. Imagine standing in a constant cone
of light. Imagine surrender. Imagine being useless.

---

A stone on the path means the tea's not ready,
a stone in the hand means somebody's angry, the stone inside you still
hasn't hit bottom.

---

There is no way to make this story interesting.
A pause, a road, the taste of grave in the mouth. The rocks dig into my skin
like arrowheads.

---

And then the sense of being smothered underneath a sack of lentils
or potatoes, or of a boat at night slamming into the docks again
without navigation, without consideration,
heedless of the planks of wood that are the dock,
that make up the berth itself.

---

I want to tell you this story without having to confess anything,
without having to say that I ran out into the street to prove something,
that he didn't love me,
that I wanted to be thrown over, possessed.

---

I want to tell you this story without having to be in it:
Max in the wrong clothes. Max at the party, drunk again.
Max in the kitchen, in refrigerator light, his hands around the neck of a beer.

---

Tell me we're dead and I'll love you even more.

---

I'm surprised that I say it with feeling.
There's a thing in my stomach about this. A simple thing. The last rung.

---

Can you see them there, by the side of the road,
not moving, not wrestling,
making a circle out of the space between the circles? Can you see them
pressed into the gravel, pressed into the dirt, pressing against each other
in an effort to make the minutes stop—

---

headlights shining in all directions, night spilling over them like
gasoline in all directions, and the dark blue over everything, and them
holding their breath—

---

I want to tell you this story without having to say that I ran out into the street
to prove something, that he chased after me
and threw me into the gravel.

---

And he knew it wasn't going to be okay, and he told me
it wasn't going to be okay.

---

And he wouldn't kiss me, but he covered my body with his body
and held me down until I promised not to run back out into the street again.

---

But the minutes don't stop. The prayer of going nowhere
going nowhere.

---

His shoulder blots out the stars but the minutes don't stop. He covers my body
with his body but the minutes
don't stop.

---

The smell of him mixed with creosote, exhaust—
There, on the ground, slipping through the minutes,
trying to notch them. Like taking the same picture over and over,
the spaces in between sealed up—

---

Like taking the same picture over and over, the spaces in between sealed up—
Knocked hard enough to make the record skip
and change its music, setting the melody on its
forward course again, circling and circling the center hole in the flat black disk.

---

And words, little words,
words too small for any hope or promise, not really soothing
but soothing nonetheless.

---

Every morning the maple leaves.
Every morning another chapter where the hero shifts
from one foot to the other. Every morning the same big
and little words all spelling out desire, all spelling out
You will be alone always and then you will die.

---

So maybe I wanted to give you something more than a catalog
of non-definitive acts,
something other than the desperation.

---

Dear So-and-So, I’m sorry I couldn’t come to your party.
Dear So-and-So, I’m sorry I came to your party
and seduced you
and left you bruised and ruined, you poor sad thing.

---

You want a better story. Who wouldn’t?

---

A forest, then. Beautiful trees. And a lady singing.
Love on the water, love underwater, love, love and so on.
What a sweet lady. Sing lady, sing!

---

Of course, she wakes the dragon.
Love always wakes the dragon and suddenly
flames everywhere.

---

I can tell already you think I’m the dragon,
that would be so like me, but I’m not. I’m not the dragon.
I’m not the princess either.

---

Who am I? I’m just a writer. I write things down.
I walk through your dreams and invent the future. Sure,
I sink the boat of love, but that comes later. And yes, I swallow
glass, but that comes later.

---

And the part where I push you
flush against the wall and every part of your body rubs against the bricks,
shut up
I’m getting to it.

---

For a while I thought I was the dragon.
I guess I can tell you that now. And, for a while, I thought I was the princess,
cotton candy pink, sitting there in my room, in the tower of the castle,
young and beautiful and in love and waiting for you with confidence

---

but the princess looks into her mirror and only sees the princess,
while I’m out here, slogging through the mud, breathing fire,
and getting stabbed to death.

---

Okay, so I’m the dragon. Big deal.
You still get to be the hero.

---

Okay, so I’m the dragon. Big deal.
You still get to be the hero.
You get magic gloves! A fish that talks! You get eyes like flashlights!
What more do you want?
I make you pancakes, I take you hunting, I talk to you as if you’re really there.
Are you there, sweetheart?

---

I make you pancakes, I take you hunting, I talk to you as if you’re
really there.
Are you there, sweetheart? Do you know me? Is this microphone live?

---

Let me do it right for once,
for the record, let me make a thing of cream and stars that becomes,
you know the story, simply heaven.

---

Inside your head you hear a phone ringing
and when you open your eyes
only a clearing with deer in it. Hello deer.
Inside your head the sound of glass,
a car crash sound as the trucks roll over and explode in slow motion.
Hello darling, sorry about that.

---

Sorry about the bony elbows, sorry we
lived here, sorry about the scene at the bottom of the stairwell
and how I ruined everything by saying it out loud.

---

You see, I take the parts that I remember and stitch them back together
to make a creature that will do what I say
or love me back.

---

I’m not really sure why I do it, but in this version you are not
feeding yourself to a bad man

---

I take it back.
The wooden halls like caskets. These terms from the lower depths.
I take them back.

---

Here is the repeated image of the lover destroyed.
Crossed out.
Clumsy hands in a dark room. Crossed out. There is something
underneath the floorboards.
Crossed out. And here is the tabernacle
reconstructed.

---

Here is the part where everyone was happy all the time and we were all
forgiven,
even though we didn’t deserve it.

---

Inside your head you hear
a phone ringing, and when you open your eyes you’re washing up
in a stranger’s bathroom,
standing by the window in a yellow towel, only twenty minutes away
from the dirtiest thing you know.

---

All the rooms of the castle except this one, says someone, and suddenly
darkness,
suddenly only darkness.

---

In the living room, in the broken yard, in the back of the car as the lights go by. In the airport bathroom’s gurgle and flush, bathed in a pharmacy of unnatural light, my hands looking weird, my face weird, my feet too far away.

---

I arrived in the city and you met me at the station, smiling in a way that made me frightened. 

---

Down the alley, around the arcade,
up the stairs of the building
to the little room with the broken faucets, your drawings, all your things

---

I looked out the window and said
This doesn’t look that much different from home,
because it didn’t,
but then I noticed the black sky and all those lights.

---

We walked through the house to the elevated train.
All these buildings, all that glass and the shiny beautiful mechanical wind.

---

We were inside the train car when I started to cry. You were crying too,
smiling and crying in a way that made me
even more hysterical.

---

You said I could have anything I wanted, but I just couldn’t say it out loud.

---

You said I could have anything I wanted, but I
just couldn’t say it out loud.
Actually, you said Love, for you,
is larger than the usual romantic love. It’s like a religion. It’s
terrifying. No one
will ever want to sleep with you.

---

Okay, if you’re so great, you do it—
here’s the pencil, make it work...

---

If the window is on your right, you are in your own bed.
If the window is over your heart, and it is painted shut, then we are breathing river water.

---

Build me a city and call it Jerusalem. Build me another and call it Jerusalem.
We have come back from Jerusalem where we found not
what we sought, so do it over, give me another version,
a different room, another hallway, the kitchen painted over
and over,
another bowl of soup.

---

The entire history of human desire takes about seventy minutes to tell.
Unfortunately, we don’t have that kind of time.

---

Forget the dragon, leave the gun on the table, this has nothing to do with happiness.

---

Let’s jump ahead to the moment of epiphany,
in gold light, as the camera pans to where
the action is,
lakeside and backlit, and it all falls into frame, close enough to see
the blue rings of my eyes as I say something ugly.
I never liked that ending either.

---

More love streaming out the wrong way,
and I don’t want to be the kind that says the wrong way.
But it doesn’t work, these erasures, this constant refolding of the pleats.

---

There were some nice parts, sure,
all lemondrop and mellonball, laughing in silk pajamas
and the grains of sugar
on the toast, love love or whatever, take a number. I’m sorry
it’s such a lousy story.

---

Dear Forgiveness, you know that recently
we have had our difficulties and there are many things
I want to ask you.
I tried that one time, high school, second lunch, and then again,
years later, in the chlorinated pool.

---

I am still talking to you about help. I still do not have these luxuries.
I have told you where I’m coming from, so put it together.

---

We clutch our bellies and roll on the floor...
When I say this, it should mean laughter,
not poison.

---

I want more applesauce. I want more seats reserved for heroes.

---

Dear Forgiveness, I saved a plate for you.
Quit milling around the yard and come inside.

---

Sunlight pouring across your skin, your shadow flat on the wall.
The dawn was breaking the bones of your heart like twigs.
You had not expected this,
the bedroom gone white, the astronomical light
pummeling you in a stream of fists.

---

You raised your hand to your face as if
to hide it, the pink fingers gone gold as the light
streamed straight to the bone,
as if you were the small room closed in glass
with every speck of dust illuminated.

---

The light is no mystery,
the mystery is that there is something to keep the light
from passing through.

---

A man walks into a bar and says:
Take my wife–please.
So you do.
You take her out into the rain and you fall in love with her
and she leaves you and you’re desolate.

---

You’re on your back in your undershirt, a broken man
on an ugly bedspread, staring at the water stains
on the ceiling.

---

You hear the first boot hit the floor and you’re looking up,
you’re waiting
because you thought it would follow

---

you thought there would be some logic, perhaps, something to pull it all together
but here we are in the weeds again,
here we are in the bowels of the thing: your world doesn’t make sense.

---

And then the second boot falls.
And then a third, a fourth, a fifth.

---


A man walks into a bar and says:
Take my wife–please.
But you take him instead.
You take him home, and you make him a cheese sandwich,
and you try to get his shoes off, but he kicks you
and he keeps kicking you.

---

You swallow a bottle of sleeping pills but they don’t work.

---

Boots continue to fall to the floor
in the apartment above you.

---

You go to work the next day pretending nothing happened.
Your co-workers ask
if everything’s okay and you tell them
you’re just tired.
And you’re trying to smile. And they’re trying to smile.

---

A man walks into a bar, you this time, and says:
Make it a double.
A man walks into a bar, you this time, and says:
Walk a mile in my shoes.

---

A man walks into a convenience store, still you, saying:
I only wanted something simple, something generic...
But the clerk tells you to buy something or get out.

---

A man takes his sadness down to the river and throws it in the river
but then he’s still left
with the river. A man takes his sadness and throws it away
but then he’s still left with his hands.

---

The blond boy in the red trunks is holding your head underwater
because he is trying to kill you,
and you deserve it, you do, and you know this,
and you are ready to die in this swimming pool
because you wanted to touch his hands and lips and this means
your life is over anyway.

---

You’re in the eighth grade. You know these things.
You know how to ride a dirt bike, and you know how to do
long division,
and you know that a boy who likes boys is a dead boy, unless
he keeps his mouth shut, which is what you
didn’t do

---

and you know that a boy who likes boys is a dead boy, unless
he keeps his mouth shut, which is what you didn’t do,
because you are weak and hollow and it doesn’t matter anymore.

---

A dark-haired man in a rented bungalow is licking the whiskey from the back of your wrist.
He feels nothing,
keeps a knife in his pocket,
peels an apple right in front of you
while you tramp around a mustard-colored room
in your underwear
drinking Dutch beer from a green bottle.

---

After everything that was going to happen has happened
you ask only for the cab fare home
and realize you should have asked for more
because he couldn't care less, either way.

---

The man on top of you is teaching you how to hate, sees you
as a piece of real estate,
just another fallow field lying underneath him
like a sacrifice.

---

He's turning your back into a table so he doesn't have to
eat off the floor, so he can get comfortable,
pressing against you until he fits, until he's made a place for himself
inside you.

---

The clock ticks from five to six. Kissing degenerates into biting.
So you get a kidney punch, a little blood in your urine.
It isn't over yet, it's just begun.

---

Says to himself
The boy's no good. The boy is just no good.
but he takes you in his arms and pushes your flesh around
to see if you could ever be ugly to him.

---

You, the now familiar whipping boy, but you're beautiful,
he can feel the dogs licking his heart.
Who gets the whip and who gets the hoops of flame?

---

He hits you and he hits you and he hits you.
Desire driving his hands right into your body.
Hush, my sweet. These tornadoes are for you.

---

You wanted to think of yourself as someone who did these kinds of things.
You wanted to be in love
and he happened to get in the way.

---

The green-eyed boy in the powder-blue t-shirt standing
next to you in the supermarket recoils as if hit,
repeatedly, by a lot of men, as if he has a history of it.
This is not your problem.
You have your own body to deal with.

---

The lamp by the bed is broken.
You are feeling things he's no longer in touch with.
And everyone is speaking softly,
so as not to wake one another.

---

The wind knocks the heads of the flowers together.
Steam rises from every cup at every table at once.
Things happen all the time, things happen every minute
that have nothing to do with us.

---

So you say you want a deathbed scene, the knowledge that comes
before knowledge,
and you want it dirty.

---

And no one can ever figure out what you want,
and you won't tell them,
and you realize the one person in the world who loves you
isn't the one you thought it would be,
and you don't trust him to love you in a way
you would enjoy.

---

And the boy who loves you the wrong way is filthy.
And the boy who loves you the wrong way keeps weakening.
You thought if you handed over your body
he'd do something interesting.

---

The stranger says there are no more couches and he will have to
sleep in your bed. You try to warn him, you tell him
you will want to get inside him, and ruin him,
but he doesn't listen.

---

You do this, you do. You take the things you love
and tear them apart
or you pin them down with your body and pretend they're yours.

---

So, you kiss him, and he doesn't move, he doesn't
pull away, and you keep on kissing him. And he hasn't moved,
he's frozen, and you've kissed him, and he'll never
forgive you, and maybe now he'll leave you alone.

---

At first there were too many branches
so he cut them and then it was winter.
He meaning you. Yes. He would look out
the window and stare at the trees that once
had too many branches and now seemed
to have too few.

---

Is that all? No, there were other attempts, breakfasts: plates served, plates carried away.

---

He doesn't know what to do with his hands.
He likes the feel of the coffeepot.
More than the hacksaw?
Yes, and he likes flipping the chairs, watching them fill with people.

---

He wants to be tender and merciful.
That sounds overly valorous.
Sounds like penance. And his hands?
His hands keep turning into birds and flying away from him.

---

Him being you.
Yes.
Do you love yourself?
I don’t have to answer that.
It should matter.
He has a body but it doesn't matter, clean sheets on the bed but it doesn't matter.

---

This is where he trots out his sadness. Little black cloud, little black umbrella.

---

You miss the point: the face in the mirror is a little
traitor, the face in the mirror is a pale
and naked hostage and no one can tell
which room he’s being held in.

---

He wants in, he wants out, he wants the antidote. He stands in front of the mirror with a net, hoping to catch something.
He wants to move forward into the afternoon because there is no other choice.

---

Everyone in this room got here somehow and everyone in this room will have to leave.

---

So what's left? Sing a song about the room we're in? Hammer in the pegs that fix the meaning to the landscape?
The voice wants to be a hand and the hand wants to do something useful.

---

What did you really want?
Someone to pass this with me.
You wanted more.
I want what everyone wants.

---

He raises the moon on a crane for effect, cue the violins.
That's what the violins are for. And yes, he raises the moon on a crane and scrubs it until it shines.
So what does it shine on?
Nothing.

---

Was there no one else?
Left-handed truth, right-handed truth, there's no pure way to say it.
The wind blows and it makes a noise. Pain makes a noise. We bang on the pipes and it makes a noise. Was there no one else?

---

His hands keep turning into birds, and his hands keep flying away from him. 
Eventually the birds must land.

---

All the cows were falling out of the sky and landing in the mud. You were drinking sangria and I was throwing oranges at you,
but it didn’t matter.

---

I said my arms are very long and your head’s on fire.
I said kiss me here and here and here
and you did.

---

Then you wanted pasta,
so we trampled out into the tomatoes and rolled around to make the sauce.
You were very beautiful.

---

We were in the Safeway parking lot. I couldn’t find my cigarettes
You said Hurry up! but I was worried there would be a holdup
and we would be stuck in a hostage situation, hiding behind
the frozen meats, with nothing to smoke for hours.

---

You said Don’t be silly,
so I followed you into the store.
We were thumping the melons when I heard somebody say Nobody move!
I leaned over and whispered in your ear I told you so.

---

There was a show on the television about buried treasure.
You were trying to convince me that we should buy shovels
and go out into the yard
and I was trying to convince you that I was a vampire.

---

On the way to the hardware store I kept biting your arm
and you said if I really was a vampire I would be biting your neck,
so I started biting your neck
and you said Cut it out!
and you bought me an ice cream, and then we saw the UFO.

---

These are the dreams we should be having. I shouldn’t have to clean them up like this.

---

You were lying in the middle of the empty highway.
The sky was red and the sand was red and you were wearing a brown coat.
There were flecks of foam in the corners of your mouth.
The birds were watching you.

---

Your eyes were closed and you were listening to the road and I could hear your breathing, I could hear your heart beating.

---

I carried you to the car and drove you home but you weren’t making any sense.

---

I took a shower and tried to catch my breath.
You were lying on top of the bedspread
in boxer shorts, watching cartoons and laughing but not making any sound.
Your skin looked blue in the television light.
Your teeth looked yellow.

---

Still wet, I lay down next to you. Your arms, your legs, your naked chest,
your ribs delineated like a junkyard dog's.
There’s nowhere to go, I thought. There’s nowhere to go.

---

You were sitting in a bathtub at the hospital and you were crying.
You said it hurt.
I mean the buildings that were not the hospital.
I shouldn’t have mentioned the hospital.
I don’t think I can take this much longer.

---

In the dream I don’t tell anyone, you put your head in my lap.

---

Let’s say you’re driving down the road with your eyes closed
but my eyes are also closed.
You’re by the side of the road.
You’re by the side of the road and you’re doing all the talking while I stare at my shoes.
They’re nice shoes, brown and comfortable, and I like your voice.

---

In the dream I don’t tell anyone, I’m afraid to wake you up.

---

In these dreams it’s always you:
the boy in the sweatshirt,
the boy on the bridge, the boy who always keeps me
from jumping off the bridge.

---

Oh, the things we invent when we are scared and want to be rescued

---

Your jeep. Your teeth. The coffee that you bought me.
The sandwich cut in half on the plate.
I woke up and ate ice cream in the dark,
hunched over on the wooden chair in the kitchen,
listening to the rain.
I borrowed your shoes and didn’t put them away.

---

You were crying and eating rice.
The surface of the water was still and bright.
Your feet were burning so I put my hands on them, but my hands were burning too.

---

You had a bottle of pills but I wouldn’t let you swallow them.
You said Will you love me even more when I'm dead?
and I said No, and I threw the pills on the sand.
Look at them, you said. They look like emeralds.

---

I put you in the cage with the ocelots. I was trying to fatten you up
with sausages and bacon.
Somehow you escaped and climbed up the branches of a pear tree.
I chopped it down but there was no one in it.

---

I went to the riverbed to wait for you to show up.
You didn't show up.
I kept waiting.

---

I watched TV. I had a Coke at the bar. I had four dreams in a row
where you were burned, about to burn, or still on fire.

---

Here you are in the straw house, feeding the straw dog. Here you are
in the wrong house, feeding the wrong dog.

---

I had a Coke with ice.
I had four dreams on TV. You have a cold cold smile.

---

You were burned, you were about to burn, you're still on fire.

---

Here you are in the straw house, feeding ice to the dog, and you wanted
an adventure, so I said Have an adventure.
The straw about to burn, the straw on fire. Here you are on the TV,
saying Watch me, just watch me.

---

Four dreams in a row, four dreams in a row, four dreams in a row,
fall down right there. I wanted to fall down right there but I knew
you wouldn’t catch me because you're dead. I swallowed crushed ice
pretending it was glass and you're dead. Ashes to ashes.

---

You wanted to be cremated so we cremated you and you wanted an adventure
so I ran and I knew you wouldn’t catch me.

---

You are a fever I am learning to live with, and everything is happening
at the wrong end of a very long tunnel.

---

You wanted to be cremated so we cremated you and you wanted an adventure
so I ran and I knew you wouldn’t catch me.
You are a fever I am learning to live with, and everything is happening
at the wrong end of a very long tunnel.

---

I woke up in the morning and I didn't want anything, didn't do anything,
couldn't do it anyway,
just lay there listening to the blood rush through me and it never made
any sense, anything.

---

And I can't eat, can't sleep, can't sit still or fix things and I wake up and I
wake up and you're still dead, you’re under the table, you’re still feeding
the damn dog, you're cutting the room in half.
Whatever. Feed him whatever. Burn the straw house down.

---

I don’t really blame you for being dead but you can't have your sweater back.

---

So, I said, now that we have our dead, what are we going to do with them?

---

There's a black dog and there's a white dog, depends on which you feed,
depends on which damn dog you live with.

---

Here we are
in the wrong tunnel, burn O burn, but it’s cold, I have clothes
all over my body, and it's raining, it wasn't supposed to.

---

And there's snow
on the TV, a landscape full of snow, falling from the fire-colored sky.
But thanks, thanks for calling it the blue sky

---

You can sleep now, you said. You can sleep now. You said that.
I had a dream where you said that. Thanks for saying that.
You weren't supposed to.

---

Chemical names, bird names, names of fire
and flight and snow, baby names, paint names,
delicate names like bones in the body,
Rumplestiltskin names that are always changing,
names that no one’s ever able to figure out.

---

Names of spells and names of hexes, names
cursed quietly under the breath, or called out
loudly to fill the yard, calling you inside again,
calling you home.

---

Nicknames and pet names
and baroque French monikers, written in
shorthand, written in longhand, scrawled
illegibly in brown ink on the backs of yellowing
photographs, or embossed on envelopes lined
with gold.

---

Names called out across the water,
names I called you behind your back,
sour and delicious, secret and unrepeatable

---

the names of flowers that open only once,
shouted from balconies, shouted from rooftops,
or muffled by pillows, or whispered in sleep,
or caught in the throat like a lump of meat.

---

I try, I do. I try and try.

---

A happy ending?
Sure enough — Hello darling, welcome home.

---

I’ll call you darling, hold you tight.
We are not traitors but the lights go out. It’s dark.
Sweetheart, is that you? 

---

There are no tears,
no pictures of him squarely. A seaside framed
in glass, and boats, those little boats with
sails aflutter, shining lights upon the water,
lights that splinter when they hit the pier.

---

His voice on tape, his name on the envelope,
the soft sound of a body falling off a bridge
behind you, the body hardly even makes
a sound.

---

The waters of the dead, a clear road,
every lover in the form of stars, the road
blocked.

---

All night I stretched my arms across
him, rivers of blood, the dark woods, singing
with all my skin and bone Please keep him safe.
Let him lay his head on my chest and we will be
like sailors, swimming in the sound of it, dashed
to pieces.

---

Makes a cathedral, him pressing against
me, his lips at my neck, and yes, I do believe
his mouth is heaven, his kisses falling over me
like stars.

---

Names of heat and names of light, names of collision in the dark, on the side of the bus, in the bark of the tree, in ballpoint pen on jeans and hands and the backs of matchbooks that then get lost.

---

Names of heat and names of light,
names of collision in the dark, on the side of the
bus, in the bark of the tree, in ballpoint pen
on jeans and hands and the backs of matchbooks
that then get lost.

---

Names like pain cries, names
like tombstones, names forgotten and reinvented,
names forbidden or overused.

---

Your name like a song I sing to myself, your name like a box
where I keep my love, your name like a nest
in the tree of love, your name like a boat in the
sea of love — O now we’re in the sea of love!

---

Your name like detergent in the washing machine.
Your name like two X’s like punched-in eyes,
like a drunk cartoon passed out in the gutter,
your name with two X’s to mark the spots,
to hold the place, to keep the treasure from becoming ever lost.

---

I’m saying your name in the grocery store, I’m saying your name on the bridge at dawn.

---

Your name like an animal
covered with frost, your name like a music that’s
been transposed, a suit of fur, a coat of mud,
a kick in the pants, a lungful of glass, the sails
in wind and the slap of waves

---

the sails in wind and the slap of waves on the hull
of a boat that’s sinking to the sound of mermaids
singing songs of love, and the tug of a simple
profound sadness when it sounds so far away.

---

Here is a map with a your name for a capital,
here is an arrow to prove a point

---

we laugh
and it pits the world against us, we laugh,
and we’ve got nothing left to lose, and our hearts
turn red, and the river rises like a barn on fire.

---

I came to tell you, we’ll swim in the water, we’ll swim like something sparkling underneath the waves.

---

Our bodies shivering, and the sound
of our breathing, and the shore so far away.
I’ll use my body like a ladder, climbing
to the thing behind it, saying farewell to flesh,
farewell to everything caught underfoot
and flattened.

---

Names of poisons, names of handguns, names of places we’ve been together, names of people we’d be together

---

If there was one thing I could save from the fire,
he said, the broken arms of the sycamore,
the eucalyptus still trying to climb out of the yard —
your breath on my neck like a music that holds
my hands down, kisses as they burn their way
along my spine

---

or rain, our bodies wet, clothes clinging arm to elbow, clothes clinging nipple to groin — I’ll be right here. I’m waiting.

---

Say hallelujah, say goodnight, say it over the canned music and your feet won’t stumble, his face getting larger, the rest blurring on every side.

---

And angels, about twelve angels, angels knocking on your head right now, hello hello, a flash in the sky, would you like to meet him there, in Heaven?

---

Imagine a room, a sudden glow. Here is my hand, my heart,
my throat, my wrist. Here are the illuminated
cities at the center of me, and here is the center
of me, which is a lake, which is a well that we can drink from

---

Here is my hand, my heart,
my throat, my wrist. Here are the illuminated
cities at the center of me, and here is the center
of me, which is a lake, which is a well that we
can drink from, but I can’t go through with it.
I just don’t want to die anymore.

---

Imagine this:
You're driving.
The sky's bright. You look great.
In a word, in a phrase, it's a movie,
you're the star.
so smile for the camera, it's your big scene,
you know your lines.

---

I'm the director. I'm in a helicopter.
I have a megaphone and you play along,
because you want to die for love,
you always have.

---

Imagine this:
You're pulling the car over. Somebody's waiting.
You're going to die
in your best friend's arms.
And you play along because it's funny, because it's written down,
you've memorized it,
it's all you know.

---

I say the phrases that keep it all going,
and everybody plays along.

---

Imagine:
Someone's pulling a gun, and you're jumping into the middle of it.
You didn't think you'd feel this way.
There's a gun in your hand.
It feels hot. It feels oily.

---

I'm the director
and I'm screaming at you,
I'm waving my arms in the sky,
and everyone's watching, everyone's
curious, everyone's
holding their breath.

---

You saved my life he says. I owe you everything.
You don’t, I say, you don’t owe me squat, let’s just get going, let’s just
get gone, but he’s relentless,
keeps saying I owe you

---

let’s just get going, let’s just
get gone, but he’s relentless,
keeps saying I owe you, says Your shoes are filling with your own
damn blood, you must want something, just tell me, and it’s yours.

---

But I can’t look at him, can hardly speak,
I took the bullet for all the wrong reasons, I’d just as soon kill you myself,
I say.

---

You keep saying I owe you, I owe... but you say the same thing every time.

---

Let’s not talk about it, let’s just not talk.
Not because I don’t believe it, not because I want it any different, but I’m
always saving and you’re always owing and I’m tired of asking to settle the debt.

---

Don’t bother. You never mean it anyway, not really, and it only makes me that much more ashamed.

---

There’s only one thing I want, don’t make me say it, just get me bandages, I’m bleeding, I’m not just making conversation.

---

There’s smashed glass glittering everywhere like stars.

---

It’s a Western, Henry. It’s a downright shoot-em-up. We’ve made a graveyard out of the bone white afternoon.

---

It’s another wrong-man-dies scenario and we keep doing it, Henry,
keep saying until we get it right... but we always win and we never quit.

---

See, we’ve won again,
here we are at the place where I get to beg for it where I get to say Please,
for just one night, will you lay down next to me, we can leave our clothes on,
we can stay all buttoned up?
But we both know how it goes–

---

I say I want you inside me and you hold my head underwater, I say I want you inside me and you split me open with a knife.

---

I’m battling monsters, I’m pulling you out of the burning buildings
and you say I’ll give you anything but you never come through.

---

Even when you’re standing up
you look like you’re lying down, but will you let me kiss your neck, baby?
Do I have to tie your arms down? Do I have to stick my tongue in your mouth like the hand of a thief,
like a burglary, like it’s just another petty theft?

---

It makes me tired, Henry. Do you see what I mean? Do you see what I’m getting at?
I swear, I end up feeling empty, like you’ve taken something out of me, and I have to search
my body for the scars, thinking Did he find that one last tender place to sink his teeth in?

---

I know you want me to say it, Henry, it’s in the script, you want me to say
Lie down on the bed, you’re all I ever wanted and worth dying for too...
but I think I’d rather keep the bullet.

---

but I think I’d rather keep the bullet. It’s mine, see, I’m not giving it up. This way you still owe me, and that’s as good as anything.

---

You can’t get out of this one, Henry, you can’t get it out of me, and with this bullet lodged in my chest, covered with your name, I will turn myself into a gun, because I’m hungry and hollow and just want something to call my own.

---

I’ll be your slaughterhouse, your killing floor, your morgue and final resting, walking around with this bullet inside me like the bullet was already there, like it’s been waiting inside me the whole time.

---

Do you want it? Do you want anything I have?
Will you throw me to the ground like you mean it, reach inside and wrestle it out with your bare hands?

---

If you love me, Henry, you don’t love me in a way I understand.

---

Do you know how it ends? Do you feel lucky? Do you want to go home now? There’s a bottle of whiskey in the trunk of the Chevy and a dead man at our feet staring up at us like we’re something interesting.

---

This is where the evening splits in half, Henry, love or death. Grab an end, pull hard, and make a wish.

---

It starts with bloodshed, always bloodshed, always the same
running from something larger than yourself story,
shoving money into the jaws of a suitcase, cutting your hair
with a steak knife at a rest stop

---

and you're off, you’re on the run, a fugitive driving away from
something shameful and half-remembered.
They're hurling their bodies down the freeway
to the smell of gasoline,
which is the sound of a voice saying I told you so.
Yes, you did dear.

---

Every story has its chapter in the desert, the long slide from kingdom
to kingdom through the wilderness,
where you learn things, where you're left to your own devices.

---

Henry’s driving,
and Theodore's bleeding shotgun into the upholstery.

---

It's a road movie,
a double-feature, two boys striking out across America, while desire,
like a monster, crawls up out of the lake
with all of us watching, with all of us wondering if these two boys will
find a way to figure it out.

---

Here is the black box, the shut eye,
the bullet pearling in his living skin. This boy, half-destroyed,
screaming Drive into that tree, drive off the embankment.
Henry, make something happen.

---

But angels are pouring out of the farmland, angels are swarming
over the grassland,
Angels rising from their little dens, arms swinging, wings aflutter,
dropping their white-hot bombs of love.

---

We are not dirty, he keeps saying. We are not dirty...

---

They want you to love the whole damn world but you won't,
you want it all narrowed down to one fleshy man in the bath,
who knows what to do with his body, with his hands.

---

It should follow,
you know this, like the panels of a comic strip,
we should be belted in, but you still can't get beyond your skin,
and they're trying to drive you into the ground, to see if anything
walks away.

---

The eye stretches to the horizon and then must continue up.
Anything past the horizon
is invisible, it can only be imagined. You want to see the future but you only see the sky. Fluffy clouds.
Look—white fluffy clouds.

---

Looking back is easy for a while and then looking back gets murky.

---

There is the road, and there is the story of where the road goes,
and then more road,
the roar of the freeway, the roar of the city sheening across the city.

---

There should be a place.
At the rest stop, in the restaurant, the overpass, the water's edge...

---

He was not dead yet, not exactly—
parts of him were dead already, certainly other parts were still only waiting
for something to happen, something grand, but it isn't
always about me,
he keeps saying, though he's talking about the only heart he knows—

---

He could build a city. Has a certain capacity. There's a niche in his chest
where a heart would fit perfectly
and he thinks if he could just maneuver one into place—
well then, game over.

---

You wonder what he's thinking when he shivers like that.
What can you tell me, what could you possibly tell me?

---

Sure, it's good to feel things, and if it hurts, we're doing it to ourselves, or so the saying goes, but there should be a different music here. 

---

There should be just one safe place
in the world, I mean
this world. People get hurt here. People fall down and stay down and I don't like
the way the song goes.

---

You, the moon. You, the road. You, the little flowers
by the side of the road. You keep singing along to that song I hate. Stop singing.

---

It was night for many miles and then the real stars in the purple sky,
like little boats rowed out too far,
begin to disappear.

---

And there, in the distance, not the promised land,
but a Holiday Inn,
with bougainvillea growing through the chain link by the pool.

---

The door swung wide: twin beds, twin lamps, twin plastic cups wrapped up in cellophane
and he says No Henry, let's not do this.
Can you see the plot like dotted lines across the room?

---

Here is the sink to wash away the blood,
here's the whiskey, the ripped-up shirt, the tile of the bathroom floor,
the disk of the drain
punched through with holes.

---

Here's the boy like a sack of meat, here are the engines, the little room
that is not a room,
the Henry that is not a Henry, the Henry with a needle and thread, hovering over the hollow boy passed out
on the universal bedspread.
Here he is again, being sewn up.

---

So now we have come to a great battlefield, the warmth of the fire,
the fire still burning,
the heat escaping like a broken promise.

---

This is the part where you wake up in your clothes again,
this is the part where you're trying to stay inside the building.
Stay in the room for now, he says. Stay in the room for now.

---

This is the place, you say to yourself, this is the place where everything
starts to begin,
the wounds reveal a thicker skin and suddenly there is no floor. 

---

Meanwhile,
there is something underneath the building that is trying very hard to get your attention---
a man with almond eyes and a zipper that runs the length of his spine.

---

You can see the shadow that the man is throwing across the linoleum,
how it resembles a boat, how it crosses the tiles just so,
the masts of his arms rasping against the windows.

---

He's pointing at you with a glass of milk
as if he's trying to tell you that there is
some sort of shining star now buried deep inside you and he has to
dig it out with a knife.

---

The bell rings, the dog growls,
and then the wind picking up, and the light falling,
and the window closing tight against the dirty rain.

---

Here is the hallway and here are the doors and here is the fear of the other thing, the relentless thing, your body drowning in gravity.

---

This is the in-between, the waiting that happens in the space between
one note and the next, the place where you confuse
his hands with the room, the dog
with the man, the blood
with the ripped-up sky.

---

He puts his hands all over you to keep you in the room.
It's night. It's noon. He's driving. It's happening
all over again.
It's love or it isn't. It isn't over.

---

You're in a car. You're in the weeds again. You're on a bumpy road
and there are criminals everywhere, longing for danger.

---

I thought I heard the clink
of ice to teeth. I thought I heard the clink of teeth to glass.

---

Open the door and the light falls in. Open your mouth and it falls right out again.

---

He's on top of you. He's next to you, right next to you in fact.
He has the softest skin wrapped entirely around him.
It isn't him.
It isn't you.

---

You're falling now. You're swimming. This is not
harmless. You are not
breathing. You're climbing out of the chlorinated pool again.

---

We have not been given all the words necessary.
We have not been given anything at all.

---

We've been driving all night.
We've been driving a long time.
We want to stop. We can't.

---

Is there an acceptable result? Do we mean something when we talk?
Is it enough that we are shuddering from the sound?

---

Left hand raising the fork to the mouth, feeling the meat slide down
your throat, thinking
My throat. Mine. Everything in this cone of light is mine.
The ashtray and the broken lamp, the filthy orange curtains and his ruined shirt.

---

I've been in your body, baby, and it was paradise.
I've been in your body and it was a carnival ride.

---

They want to stop but they can't stop. They don't know what they're doing.
This is not harmless, the how to touch it, we do not want the screen
completely
lifted from our eyes, just lifted long enough to see the holes.

---

Tired and sore and rubbed the wrong way,
rubbed raw and throbbing in the light.
They want to stop but they don't stop. They cannot get the bullet out.

---

Cut me open and the light streams out.
Stitch me up and the light keeps streaming out between the stitches.

---

He cannot get the bullet out, he thinks, he can't, and then he does. A little piece of grit to build a pearl around.

---

He cannot get the bullet out, he thinks, he can't, and then he does.

---

Midnight June. Midnight July. They've been going at it for days now.
Getting the bullet out.
Digging out the bullet and holding it up to the light, the light. Digging out the bullet and holding it up to the light.

---

There are two twins on motorbikes but one is farther up the road, beyond the hairpin turn, or just before it, depending on which twin you are in love with at the time.

---

Do not choose sides yet. It is still to your advantage to remain impartial. Both motorbikes are shiny red and both boys have perfect teeth, dark hair, soft hands.

---

The one in front will want to take you apart, and slowly. His deft and stubby fingers searching every shank and lock for weaknesses. You could love this boy with all your heart. The other brother only wants to stitch you back together.

---

The sun shines down. It's a beautiful day. Consider the hairpin turn. Do not choose sides yet.

---

There are two twins on motorbikes but one is farther up the road. Let's call them Jeff. And because the first Jeff is in front we'll consider him the older, and therefore responsible for lending money and the occasional punch in the shoulder.

---

World-wise, world-weary, and not his mother's favorite, this Jeff will always win when it all comes down to fisticuffs. Unfortunately for him, it doesn't always all come down to fisticuffs.

---

Jeff is thinking about his brother down the winding road behind him. He is thinking that if only he could cut him open and peel him back and crawl inside this second skin, then he could relive that last mile again: reborn, wild-eyed, free.

---

There are two twins on motorbikes but one is farther up the road, beyond the hairpin turn, or just before it, depending on which Jeff you are.

---

It could have been so beautiful — you scout out the road ahead and I will watch your back, how it was and how it will be, memory and fantasy — but each Jeff wants to be the other one.

---

My name is Jeff and I'm tired of looking at the back of your head. My name is Jeff and I'm tired of seeing my hand me down clothes.

---

They are the same and they are not the same. They are the same and they hate each other for it.

---

Your name is Jeff and somewhere up ahead of you your brother has pulled to the side of the road and he is waiting for you with a lug wrench clutched in his greasy fist.

---

O how he loves you, darling boy. O how, like always, he invents the monsters underneath the bed to get you to sleep next to him, chest to chest or chest to back, the covers drawn around you in an act of faith against the night.

---

When he throws the wrench into the air it will catch the light as it spins toward you. Look — it looks like a star. You had expected something else, anything else, but the wrench never reaches you. It hangs in the air like that, spinning in the air like that. It's beautiful.

---

Let's say God in his High Heaven is hungry and has decided to make himself some tuna fish sandwiches. He's already finished making two of them, on sourdough, before he realizes that the fish is bad. What is he going to do with these sandwiches?

---

What is he going to do with these sandwiches? They're already made, but he doesn't want to eat them.

---

Let's say the Devil is played by two men. We'll call them Jeff. Dark hair, green eyes, white teeth, pink tongues—they're twins. The one on the left has gone bad in the middle, and the other one on the left is about to.

---

they're twins. The one on the left has gone bad in the middle, and the other one on the left is about to. As they wrestle, you can tell that they have forgotten about God, and they are very hungry.

---

You are playing cards with three men named Jeff. Two of the Jeffs seem somewhat familiar, but the Jeff across from you keeps staring at your hands, your mouth, and you're certain that you've never seen this Jeff before.

---

but the Jeff across from you keeps staring at your hands, your mouth, and you're certain that you've never seen this Jeff before. But he's on your team, and you're ahead, you're winning big, and yet the other Jeffs keep smiling at you like there's no tomorrow.

---

They all have perfect teeth: white, square, clean, even. And, for some reason, the lighting in the room makes their teeth seem closer than they should be, as if each mouth was a place, a living room with pink carpet and the window's open. Come back from the window, Jefferson.

---

Come back from the window, Jefferson. Take off those wet clothes and come over here, by the fire.

---

You are playing cards with three Jeffs. One is your father, one is your brother, and the other is your current boyfriend. All of them have seen you naked and heard you talking in your sleep.

---

Your boyfriend Jeff gets up to answer the phone. To them he is a mirror, but to you he is a room.

---

Phone's for you, Jeff says. Hey! It's Uncle Jeff, who isn't really your uncle, but you can't talk right now, one of the Jeffs has put his tongue in your mouth. Please let it be the right one.

---

Two brothers are fighting by the side of the road. Two motorbikes have fallen over on the shoulder, leaking oil into the dirt, while the interlocking brothers grapple and swing.

---

You see them through the backseat window as you and your parents drive past. You are twelve years old. You do not have a brother. You have never experienced anything this ferocious or intentional with another person.

---

You are twelve years old. You do not have a brother. You have never experienced anything this ferocious or intentional with another person. Your mother is pretending that she hasn't seen anything. Your father is fiddling with the knobs of the radio.

---

There is an empty space next to you in the backseat of the station wagon. Make it the shape of everything you need. Now say hello.

---

You are lying on your back, on the top bunk, very close to the textured ceiling, staring straight at it in fact, and the room is still dark except for a wedge of powdery light that spills in from the adjoining bathroom.

---

The bathroom is covered in mint green tile and someone is in there, singing very softly. Is he singing to you? For you?

---

Black cherries in chocolate, the ring around the moon, a beetle underneath a glass—you cannot make out all the words, but you're sure he knows you're in there, and he's singing to you, even though you don't know who he is.

---

You see it as a room, a tabernacle, the dark hotel. You're in the hallway again, and you open the door

---

You're in the hallway again, and you open the door, and if you're ready you'll see it, but maybe one part of your mind decides that the other parts aren't ready, and then you don't remember where you've been, and you find yourself down the hall again

---

you find yourself down the hall again, the lights gone dim as the left hand sings the right hand back to sleep.

---

It's a puzzle: each piece, each room, each time you put your hand to the knob, your mouth to the hand, your ear to the wound that whispers.

---

You're in the hallway again. The radio is playing your favorite song.
You're in the hallway. Open the door again. Open the door.

---

Suppose for a moment that the heart has two heads, that the heart has been chained and dunked in a glass booth filled with river water. The heart is monologing about hesitation and fulfillment while behind the red brocade the heart is drowning. Can the heart escape?

---

The heart is monologing about hesitation and fulfillment while behind the red brocade the heart is drowning. Can the heart escape? Does love even care? Snow falls as we dump the booth in the bay.

---

Suppose for a moment we are crowded around a pier, waiting for something to ripple the water. We believe in you. There is no danger. It is not getting dark, we want to say.

---

Consider the hairpin turn. It is waiting for you like a red door or the broken leg of a dog. The sun is shining, O how the sun shines down!

---

Your speedometer and your handgrips and the feel of the road below you, how it knows you, the black ribbon spread out on the greens between these lines that suddenly don't reach to the horizon.

---

It is waiting, like a broken door, like the red dog that chases its tail and eats your rosebushes and then must be forgiven. Who do you love, Jeff? Who do you love? You were driving toward something and then, well, then you found yourself driving the other way. The dog is asleep.

---

You were driving toward something and then, well, then you found yourself driving the other way. 

---

Who do you love, Jeff? Who do you love? You were driving toward something and then, well, then you found yourself driving the other way.

---

The dog is asleep. The road is behind you. O how the sun shines down.

---

This time everyone has the best intentions. You have cancer. Let's say you have cancer. Let's say you've swallowed a bad thing and now it's got its hands inside you.

---

Let's say you've swallowed a bad thing and now it's got its hands inside you. This is the essence of love and failure. You see what I mean but you're happy anyway, and that's okay, it's a love story after all, a lasting love, a wonderful adventure with lots of action

---

You see what I mean but you're happy anyway, and that's okay, it's a love story after all, a lasting love, a wonderful adventure with lots of action, where the mirror says mirror and the hand says hand and the front door never says Sorry Charlie.

---

So the doctor says you need more stitches and the bruise cream isn't working. So much for the facts.

---

Let's say you're still completely in the dark but we love you anyway. We love you. We really do.

---

After work you go to the grocery store to get some milk and a carton of cigarettes. Where did you get those bruises? You don't remember.

---

Work was boring. You find a jar of bruise cream and a can of stewed tomatoes. Maybe a salad? Spinach, walnuts, blue cheese, apples, and you can't decide between the Extra Large or Jumbo black olives. Which is bigger anyway?

---

While you're deciding, the afternoon light is streaming through the windows behind the bank of checkout counters. Take the light inside you like a blessing, like a knee in the chest, holding onto it and not letting it go. Now let it go.

---

Like sandpaper, the light, or a blessing, or a bruise. 

---

Like sandpaper, the light, or a blessing, or a bruise. Blood everywhere, he said, the red light hemorrhaging from everywhere at once.

---

The train station blue, your lips blue, hands cold and the blue wind.

---

Or a horse, your favorite horse now raised up again out of the mud and galloping galloping always toward you. In your ruined shirt, on the last day, while the bruise won't heal, and the stain stays put, the red light streaming in from everywhere at once.

---

the bruise won't heal, and the stain stays put, the red light streaming in from everywhere at once. Your broken ribs, the back of your head, your hand to mouth or hand to now, right now, like you mean it, like it's splitting you in two. Now look at the lights, the lights.

---

You and your lover are making out in the corner booth of a seedy bar. The booths are plush and the drinks are cheap and in this dim and smoky light you can barely tell whose hands are whose.

---

Someone raises their glass for a toast. Is that the Hand of Judgment or the Hand of Mercy?

---

The bartender smiles, running a rag across the burnished wood of the bar. The drink in front of you has already been paid for. Drink it, the bartender says. It's yours, you deserve it. It's already been paid for. Somebody's paid for it already.

---

There's no mistake, he says. It's your drink, the one you asked for, just the way you like it. How can you refuse Hands of fire, hands of air, hands of water, hands of dirt.

---

Someone's doing all the talking but no one's lips move. Consider the hairpin turn.

---

The motorbikes are neck and neck but where's the checkered flag we all expected, waving in the distance, telling you you're home again, home? He's next to you, right next to you in fact, so close, or...he isn't.

---

Imagine a room. Yes, imagine a room: two chairs facing the window but nobody moves. Don't move. Keep staring straight into my eyes.

---

It feels like you're not moving, the way when, dancing, the room will suddenly fall away. You're dancing: you're neck and neck or cheek to cheek, he's there or he isn't, the open road. Imagine a room. Imagine you're dancing. Imagine the room now falling away. Don't move.

---

Two brothers: one of them wants to take you apart. Two brothers: one of them wants to put you back together. It's time to choose sides now. The stitches or the devouring mouth?

---

You want an alibi? You don't get an alibi, you get two brothers. Here are two Jeffs. Pick one.

---

Here are two Jeffs. Pick one. This is how you make the meaning, you take two things and try to define the space between them. Jeff or Jeff? Who do you want to be?

---

You just wanted to play in your own backyard, but you don't know where your own yard is, exactly. You just wanted to prove there was one safe place, just one safe place where you could love him.

---

You just wanted to prove there was one safe place, just one safe place where you could love him. You have not found that place yet. You have not made that place yet. You are here. You are here. You're still right here.

---

Here are your names and here is the list and here are the things you left behind: The mark on the floor from pushing your chair back, your underwear, one half brick of cheese, the kind I don't like, wrapped up, and poorly, and abandoned on the second shelf

---

here are your house keys, and here are the curtains that your cat peed on. And here is your cat, who keeps eating grass and vomiting in the hallway. Here is the list with all of your names, Jeff. They're not the same name, Jeff. They're not the same at all.

---

There are two twins on motorbikes but they are not on motorbikes, they're in a garden where the flowers are as big as thumbs. Imagine you are in a field of daisies. What are you doing in a field of daisies? Get up!

---

Let's say you're not in the field anymore. Let's say they're not brothers anymore. That's right, they're not brothers, they're just one guy, and he knows you, and he's talking to you, but you're in pain and you cannot understand him.

---

What are you still doing in this field? Get out of the field! You should be in the hotel room! You should, at least, be trying to get back into the hotel room. Ah! Now the field is empty.

---

Hold onto your voice. Hold onto your breath. Don't make a noise, don't leave the room until I come back from the dead for you. I will come back from the dead for you.

---

This could be a city. This could be a graveyard. This could be the basket of a big balloon. Leave the lights on. Leave a trail of letters like those little knots of bread we used to dream about.

---

Leave a trail of letters like those little knots of bread we used to dream about. We used to dream about them. We used to do a lot of things.

---

Put your hand to the knob, your mouth to the hand, pick up the bread and devour it. I'm in the hallway again, I'm in the hallway. The radio's playing my favorite song. Leave the lights on. Keep talking. I'll keep walking toward the sound of your voice.

---

The radio's playing my favorite song. Leave the lights on. Keep talking. I'll keep walking toward the sound of your voice.

---

Someone had a party while you were sleeping but you weren't really sleeping, you were sick, and parts of you were burning, and you couldn't move. Perhaps the party was in your honor.

---

Perhaps the party was in your honor. You can't remember. It seems the phone was ringing in the dream you were having but there's no proof. A dish in the sink that might be yours, some clothes on the floor that might belong to someone else.

---

When was the last time you found yourself looking out of this window. Hey! This is a beautiful window! This is a beautiful view! 1 hose trees lined up like that, and the way the stars are spinning over them like that, spinning in the air like that, like wrenches.

---

When was the last time you found yourself looking out of this window. Hey! This is a beautiful window! This is a beautiful view!

---

Let's say that God is the space between two men and the Devil is the space between two men. Here: I'll be all of them-

---

Jeff and Jeff and Jeff and Jeff are standing on the shoulder of the highway, four motorbikes knocked over, two wrenches spinning in the ordinary air. Two of these Jeffs are windows, and two of these Jeffs are doors, and all of these Jeffs are trying to tell you something.

---

Come closer. We'll whisper it in your ear. It's like seeing your face in a bowl of soup, cream of potato, and the eyes shining back like spoons. If we wanted to tell you everything, we would leave more footprints in the snow or kiss you harder. One thing. Come closer. Listen...

---

If we wanted to tell you everything, we would leave more footprints in the snow or kiss you harder. 

---

You're in a car with a beautiful boy, and he won't tell you that he loves you, but he loves you.

---

You're in a car with a beautiful boy, and he won't tell you that he loves you, but he loves you. And you feel like you've done something terrible, like robbed a liquor store, or swallowed pills, or shoveled yourself a grave in the dirt, and you're tired.

---

You're in a car with a beautiful boy, and you're trying not to tell him that you love him, and you're trying to choke down the feeling, and you're trembling, but he reaches over and he touches you, like a prayer for which no words exist

---

and you're trying to choke down the feeling, and you're trembling, but he reaches over and he touches you, like a prayer for which no words exist, and you feel your heart taking root in your body, like you've discovered something you don't even have a name for.

---

Driving, dogs barking, how you get used to it, how you make the new street yours.

---

Trees outside the window and a big band sound that makes you feel like
everything's okay,
a feeling that lasts for one song maybe,
the parentheses all clicking shut behind you.

---

The way we move through time and space, or only time.
The way it's night for many miles, and then suddenly
it's not, it's breakfast
and you're standing in the shower for over an hour,
holding the bar of soap up to the light.

---

I will keep watch. I will water the yard.

---

Knot the tie and go to work. Unknot the tie and go to sleep.

---

I sleep. I dream. I make up things that I would never say. I say them very quietly.

---

The trees in wind, the streetlights on,
the click and flash of cigarettes
being smoked on the lawn, and just a little kiss before we say goodnight.

---

It spins like a wheel inside you: green yellow, green blue,
green beautiful green.
It's simple: it isn't over, it's just begun. It's green. It's still green.

---

Close your eyes. A lover is standing too close
to focus on. Leave me blurry and fall toward me
with your entire body. Lie under the covers, pretending
to sleep, while I'm in the other room.

---

Imagine my legs crossed, my hair combed, the shine of my boots
in the slatted light. I'm thinking My plant, his chair,
the ashtray that we bought together. I'm thinking This is where we live.

---

When we were little we made houses out of cardboard boxes. We can do anything. It's not because our hearts are large, they're not, it's what we struggle with. 

---

It's not because our hearts are large, they're not, it's what we struggle with. The attempt to say Come over. Bring your friends. It's a potluck, I'm making pork chops, I'm making those long noodles you love so much.

---

My dragonfly, my black-eyed fire, the knives in the kitchen are singing for blood, but we are the crossroads, my little outlaw, and this is the map of my heart

---

the knives in the kitchen are singing for blood, but we are the crossroads, my little outlaw, and this is the map of my heart, the landscape after cruelty which is, of course, a garden, which is a tenderness, which is a room, a lover saying Hold me tight, it's getting cold.

---

We have not touched the stars,
nor are we forgiven, which brings us back
to the hero's shoulders and the gentleness that comes,
not from the absence of violence, but despite
the abundance of it.

---

The lawn drowned, the sky on fire,
the gold light falling backward through the glass
of every room. I'll give you my heart to make a place
for it to happen, evidence of a love that transcends hunger.

---

Is that too much to expect? That I would name the stars for you? That I would take you there?

---

Is that too much to expect? That I would name the stars for you? That I would take you there? The splash of my tongue melting you like a sugar cube? 

---

We've read the back of the book, we know what's going to happen.
The fields burned, the land destroyed, the lovers left
broken in the brown dirt. And then it's gone.
Makes you sad. All your friends are gone. Goodbye
Goodbye. No more tears. I would like to meet you all
in Heaven. 

---

But there's a litany of dreams that happens
somewhere in the middle. Moonlight spilling
on the bathroom floor. A page of the book where we
transcend the story of our lives, past the taco stands
and record stores.

---

Moonlight spilling
on the bathroom floor. A page of the book where we
transcend the story of our lives, past the taco stands
and record stores. Moonlight making crosses
on your body, and me putting my mouth on every one.

---

We have been very brave, we have wanted to know the worst, wanted the curtain to be lifted from our eyes.

---

This dream going on with all of us in it. Penciling in the bighearted slob. Penciling in his outstretched arms.

---

Our father who art in Heaven. Our father who art buried
in the yard. Someone is digging your grave right now.
Someone is drawing a bath to wash you clean, he said,
so think of the wind, so happy, so warm.

---

It's a fairy tale, the story underneath the story, sliding down the polished halls, lightning here and gone.

---

We make these ridiculous idols so we can pray to what's behind them, but what happens after we get up the ladder? Do we simply stare at what's horrible and forgive it?

---

Here is the river, and here is the box, and here are the monsters we put in the box to test our strength against.

---

Here is the cake, and here is the fork, and here's the desire to put it inside us, and then the question behind every question: What happens next?

---

The way you slam your body into mine reminds me
I'm alive, but monsters are always hungry, darling,
and they're only a few steps behind you, finding
the flaw, the poor weld, the place where we weren't
stitched up quite right

---

the flaw, the poor weld, the place where we weren't
stitched up quite right, the place they could almost
slip right through if the skin wasn't trying to
keep them out, to keep them here, on the other side
of the theater where the curtain keeps rising.

---

I crawled out the window and ran into the woods. I had to make up all the words myself. The way they taste, the way they sound in the air. I passed through the narrow gate, stumbled in, stumbled around, and stumbled back out. I made this place for you. A place for you to love me.

---

I made this place for you. A place for you to love me.
If this isn't a kingdom then I don't know what is.

---

So how would you catalog it? Dawn in the fields?
Snow and dirty rain? Light brought in in buckets?
I was trying to describe the kingdom, but the letters kept smudging as I wrote them

---

the hunter's heart, the hunter's mouth, the trees and the trees and the space between the trees, swimming in gold. The words frozen. The creatures frozen. The plum sauce leaking out of the bag. Explaining will get us nowhere.

---

I was away, I don't know where, lying on the floor,
pretending I was dead. I wanted to hurt you
but the victory is that I could not stomach it.

---

We have swallowed him up, they said. It's beautiful. It really is.

---

I had a dream about you. We were in the gold room
where everyone finally gets what they want.

---

You said Tell me about your books, your visions made of flesh and light and I said This is the Moon. This is the Sun. Let me name the stars for you. Let me take you there. The splash of my tongue melting you like a sugar cube...

---

We were in the gold room where everyone finally gets what they want, so I said What do you want, sweetheart? and you said Kiss me.

---

Here I am
leaving you clues. I am singing now while Rome burns. We are all just trying to be holy.

---

My applejack, my silent night, just mash your lips against me.
We are all going forward. None of us are going back.

---

The paint doesn’t move the way the light reflects,
so what’s there to be faithful to?

---

The paint doesn’t move the way the light reflects,
so what’s there to be faithful to? I am faithful
to you, darling. I say it to the paint.

---

The bird floats in the unfinished sky with nothing to hold it.

---

The man stands, the day shines. His insides and his outsides kept apart with an imaginary line — thick and rude and imaginary because there is no separation, fallacy of the local body, paint on paint.

---

I have my body and you have yours.
Believe it if you can.

---

Negative space is silly.
When you bang on the wall you have to remember
you’re on both sides of it already but go ahead,
yell at yourself.

---

Some people don’t understand anything. They see the man but not the light, they see the field but not the varnish. There is no light in the paint, so how can you argue with them? They are probably right anyway.

---

I paint in his face and I paint it out again. There is a question I am afraid to ask: to supply the world with what?

---

To have a thought, there must be an object—
the field is empty, sloshed with gold, a hayfield thick
with sunshine. There must be an object so land
a man there, solid on his feet, on solid ground, in
a field fully flooded, enough light to see him clearly

---

there must be an object so land
a man there, solid on his feet, on solid ground, in
a field fully flooded, enough light to see him clearly,
the light on his skin and bouncing off his skin.

---

He’s easy to desire since there’s not much to him,
vague and smeary in his ochers, in his umbers,
burning in the open field.

---

Forget about his insides,
his plumbing and his furnaces, put a thing in his hand
and be done with it. No one wants to know what’s in his head.

---

It should be enough. To make something beautiful should be enough.

---

It should be enough. To make something
beautiful should be enough. It isn’t. It should be.

---

The smear of his head—I paint it out, I paint it in
again. I ask it what it wants. I want to be a cornerstone,
says the head. Let’s kill something.

---

Land a man in a landscape and he’ll try to conquer it. Make him handsome and you’re a fascist, make him ugly and you’re saying nothing new. The conqueror suits up and takes the field, his horse already painted in beneath him. What do you do with a man like that?

---

What do you do with a man like that?
While you are deciding, more men ride in. The hand
sings weapon. The mind says tool. The body swerves
in the service of the mind, which is evidence of
the mind but not actual proof. More conquerors.

---

More conquerors.
They swarm the field and their painted flags unfurl.
Crown yourself with leaves and stake your claim
before something smears up the paint.

---

I turned away
from darkness to see daylight, to see what would
happen. What happened? What does a man want?
Power. The men spread, the thought extends. I paint
them out, I paint them in again. A blur of forces.

---

I turned away from darkness to see daylight, to see what would happen.

---

Why take more than we need? Because we can.
Deep footprint, it leaves a hole. You’d break your
heart to make it bigger, so why not crack your skull
when the mind swells. A thought bigger than your
own head. Try it. Seriously. Cover more ground.

---

I thought of myself as a city and I licked my lips.
I thought of myself as a nation and I wrung my hands,
I put a thing in your hand. Will you defend yourself?
From me, I mean. Let's kill something.

---

The mind moves forward, the paint layers up: glop glop and
shellac. I shovel the color into our faces, I shovel our
faces into our faces. They look like me. I move them
around. I prefer to blame others, it’s easier. King me.

---

I cut off my head and threw it in the sky. It turned
into birds. I called it thinking.

---

The view from above—
untethered scrutiny. It helps to have an anchor
but your head is going somewhere anyway. It's a matter of willpower.

---

O little birds, you flap around and make a mess of the milk-blue sky—all these ghosts come streaming down and sometimes I wish I had something else. A redemptive imagination, for example.

---

The life of the mind is a disappointment,
but remember what stands for what. We deduce
backwards into first causes—stone in the pond of things,
splash splash—or we throw ourselves into the future.
We all move forward anyway. Ripples is all directions.

---

What is a ghost? Something dead that seems to be
alive. Something dead that doesn't know it's dead.

---

A painting, for instance. An abstraction. Cut off your head, kid. For all the good it'll do ya. I glued my head back on. All thoughts finish themselves eventually. I wish it were true. Paint all the men you want but sooner or later they go to ground and rot.

---

The mind fights the body and the body fights the land. It wants our bodies, the landscape does, and everyone runs the risk of being swallowed up. Can we love nature for what it really is: predatory?

---

We do not walk through a passive landscape. The paint dries eventually. The bodies decompose eventually.

---

We collide with place, which is another name for God, and limp away with a permanent injury. Ask for a blessing? You can try, but we will not remain unscathed.

---

Flex your will or abandon your will and let the world have its way with you, or disappear and save everyone the bother of a dark suit. Why live a life? Well, why are you asking? I put on my best shirt because the painting looked so bad.

---

Why live a life? Well, why are you asking? I put on my best shirt because the painting looked so bad. Color bleeds, so make it work for you. Gravity pulls, so make it work for you. Rubbing your feet at night or clutching your stomach in the morning.

---

It was illegible—no line of sight,
too many angles of approach, smoke in the distance.
It made no sense. When you have nothing to say,
set something on fire. A blurry landscape is useless.

---

When you have nothing to say, set something on fire. A blurry landscape is useless.

---

I saw them hiding in the yellow field, crouching low in the vanished dark. I followed them pretending they were me because they were. I wanted to explain myself to myself in an understandable way.

---

I wanted to explain myself to myself in an understandable way. I gave shape to my fears and made excuses. I varied my velocities, watched myselves sleep.

---

My inner life is a sheet of black glass. If I fell through the floor I would keep falling.

---

The enormity of my desire disgusts me. I kissed my mouth, it was no longer a mouth. I threw a spear at my head, I didn't have a head.

---

Fox. At the throat of. The territory is more complex that I supposed. What does a body of knowledge look like? A body, any body.

---

Look away but I'm still there. Birds flying but I'm still there, lurk there. Not just one of me but multitudes in the hayfield. Want someone to chase you? Run.

---

Want someone to chase you? Run.

---

Take a body, dump it, drive. Take a body, maybe your own, and dump it gently. All your dead, unfinished selves and dump them gently. Take only what you need.

---

The machine of the world—if you don't grab on, you begin to tremble. And if you do grab on, then everything trembles.

---

I spent my lamp and cleft my head. Deep-wounded mind, I wasn't doing anything with it anyway. And the birds looking for a place to land.

---

I would like to say something about grace, and the brown corduroy thrift store coat I bought for eight-fifty when you told me my paintings were empty. Never finish a war without starting another.

---

I've seen your true face: the back of your head. If you were walking away, keep walking.

---

I followed myself for a long while, deep into the field.
Two heads full of garbage.
Our scope was larger than I realized,
which only made me that much more responsible.
Yellow, yellow, gold, and ocher.
We stopped. We held the field. We stood very still.
Everyone needs a place.

---

Everyone needs a place.
You need it for the moment you need it, then you bless it—
thank you soup, thank you flashlight—
and move on. Who does this? No one.

---

A man saw a bird and found him beautiful. The bird had a song inside him, and feathers. Sometimes the man felt like the bird and sometimes the man felt like a stone — solid, inevitable

---

Sometimes the man felt like the bird and sometimes the man felt like a stone—solid, inevitable—but mostly he felt like a bird, or that there was a bird inside him, or that something inside him was like a bird fluttering. This went on for a long time.

---

A man saw a bird and wanted to paint it. The problem, if there was one, was simply a problem with the questions. Why paint a bird? Why do anything at all?

---

Why paint a bird? Why do anything at all? Not how, because hows are easy — series of sequence, one foot after the other — but existentially why bother, what does it solve?

---

And just because you want to paint a bird, do actually paint a bird, it doesn't mean you've accomplished anything. Who gets to measure the distance between experience and its representation? Who controls the lines of inquiry? We do. Anyone can.

---

Blackbird, he says. So be it, indexed and normative. But it isn't a bird, it's a man in a bird suit, blue shoulders instead of feathers, because he isn't looking at a bird, real bird, as he paints, he is looking at his heart, which is impossible.

---

Unless his heart is a metaphor for his head, as everything is a metaphor for itself, so that looking at the paint is like looking at a bird that isn't there, with a song in its throat that you don't want to hear but you paint anyway.

---

The hand is a voice that can sing what the voice will not, and the hand wants to do something useful.

---

Sometimes, at night, in bed, before I fall asleep, I think about a poem I might write, someday, about my heart, says the heart.

---

They looked at the animals. They looked at the walls of the cave. This is earlier, these are different men. They painted in torchlight: red mostly, sometimes black— mammoth, lion, horse, bear—things on a wall, in profile or superimposed, dynamic and alert.

---

They weren't animals but they looked like animals, enough like animals to make it confusing, meant something but the meaning was slippery

---

it wasn't there but it remained, looked like the thing but wasn't the thing—was a second thing, following a second set of rules—and it was too late: their power over it was no longer absolute.

---

What is alive and what isn't and what should we do about it? Theories: about the nature of the thing. And of the soul. Because people die. The fear: that nothing survives. The greater fear: that something does.

---

The night sky is vast and wide. They huddled closer, shoulder to shoulder, painted themselves in herds, all together and apart from the rest. They looked at the sky, and at the mud, and at their hands in the mud, and their dead friends in the mud. This went on for a long time.

---

To be a bird, or a flock of birds doing something together, one or many, starling or murmuration. To be a man on a hill, or all the men on all the hills, or half a man shivering in the flock of himself. These are some choices. The night sky is vast and wide.

---

A man had two birds in his head—not in his throat, not in his chest—and the birds would sing all day never stopping. The man thought to himself, One of these birds is not my bird. The birds agreed.

---

A thing and a thing and a thing held still— you have to hold something still to find the other things. This is speculation. You will die in your sleep and leave everything unfinished. This is also speculation.

---

A thing and a thing and a thing held still— you have to hold something still to find the other things.

---

I had obligations: hope, but hope negates the experience. I owe myself nothing.

---

I cut off my head and threw it on the ground. I walked away. This is how we measure, walking away. We carve up the world into feet and minutes, to know how far from home, how many hogs in the yard. My head just sat there. Fair enough. A map without landmarks is useless.

---

Science dreams it dreams of knowledge—names it, pokes it with equations. The crucial thing is not fifty times whatever but how we got these notions: how much, how much, how far, how long.

---

It's good to give explicit answers, showing all the steps, necessary and sufficient. Finding the dots, connecting the dots. An interrogation of the dots. A pip, a point, a seed, a stone. This is philosophy. There are suppositions. If one has no apples, one has zero apples.

---

This is philosophy. There are suppositions. If one has no apples, one has zero apples.

---

If one has no apples, one has zero apples. There is, you see, no shortage of open problems. We carve up the world and crown it with numbers—lumens, ounces, decibels. All these things and what to do with them. We carve up the world all the time.

---

I like dead things, says the landscape. They cannot hurt me.

---

The armies swarm the cities of the yellow field
and burn them down. There's not enough room for us
to be ourselves, say the soldiers streaming across
the plains. So you will have to be pushed out of the way.

---

We like things related to our survival: soup, arrows—
they expand the range of the species. Goldmine,
goldmine, landmine. War, and the art of war, and the
landscape of war.

---

Grant me freedom from objects,
says the painting. I will help you, says the paint.

---

More territories. We sat in our tanks and rolled
over our enemies. We trampled everything into
noise and mud. Willpower, gunpowder, concussive
thunder. Pink, orange, red, orange dreaming red.

---

I am the fire, says the fire. My body is a graveyard,
says the landscape. You're welcome, says the landscape.
Gold bodies on the red, red ground. I paint in the wounds.

---

Socket, says the shoulder. Shoulder, says the socket. Let's kill everything, says everything else.

---

Smeared night, smudged dawn. I saw him fall. Them,
falling. Split and felled and pounded into the ground.

---

We knocked the heads off the statuary, deprived
the landmarks of any meaning. Victory swelling
in the occupation. History is painted by the winners.
Keep your paints wet. Trust me, I have things to say.

---

A man with a bandage is in the middle of something.
Everyone understands this. Everyone wants a battlefield.
Red. And a little more red.

---

Accidents never happen when the room is empty.
Everyone understands this. Everyone needs a place.

---

People like to think war means something.
What can you learn from your opponent? More than you think.
Who will master this love? Love might be the wrong word.

---

Let's admit, without apology, what we do to each other.
We know who our enemies are. We know.

---

Inside the warren, the rabbits think fast. Pip touches the only other rabbit listening.
Pip: We're doomed.
Flip: We're not.
Pip: Are you sure?
Flip: Yes. Here, hide inside me.

---

This is the story of Pip and Flip, the bunny twins. We say that once there were two and now there is only one. When the fox sees Pip run past, he won't know that the one is inside the other. He'll think, Well, there's at least one more rabbit in that warren. But no one's left.

---

But no one's left. You know this and I know this. Together we trace out the trail away from doom. There isn't hope, there is a trail. I follow you.

---

Together we trace out the trail away from doom. There isn't hope, there is a trail. I follow you.

---

When a rabbit meets a rabbit, one takes the time to tell the other this story. The rabbits then agree there must be two rabbits, at least two rabbits, and that in turn there is a trace. I am only repeating what I heard. This is one love. There are many loves but only one war.

---

I am only repeating what I heard. This is one love. There are many loves but only one war.
Bird 1: This is the same story.
Bird 2: No, this is the rest of the story.

---

Let me tell you a story about war. A man found his life to be empty. He began to study Latin. Latin was difficult for the man to understand. I will study Latin, even though it is difficult, said the man. Yes, even if it is difficult.

---

A man had a dream about a woman and then he met her. The man had a dream about the woman's former lover. the former lover was sad, he wanted to fight. The man said to the woman, I will have to comfort your former lover or I will always be fighting him in my dreams.

---

the former lover was sad, he wanted to fight. The man said to the woman, I will have to comfort your former lover or I will always be fighting him in my dreams. Yes, said the woman. You will need to comfort him, or we will never be finished with this.

---

A fisherman's son and his dead brother sat on the shore. That is my country and this is your country and the line in the sand is the threshold between them, said the dead brother. Yes, said the fisherman's son.
You cannot have an opponent if you keep saying yes.

---

You cannot have an opponent if you keep saying yes.

---

Bird 1: This is the wrong story.
Bird 2: All stories are the wrong story when you are impatient.

---

Let me tell you a story about war. A man says to another man, Can I tell you something? The other man says, No. A man says to another man, There is something I have to tell you. No, says the other man. No, you don't.

---

Bird 1: Now we are getting somewhere.
Bird 2: Yes, yes we are.

---

A boy spills a glass of milk and his father picks him up by the back of the shirt and throws him against the wall. You killed my wife and you can't even keep a glass on the table.

---

You killed my wife and you can't even keep a glass on the table. The wife had died of sadness, by her own hand. The father walks out of the room and the room is almost empty.
The road outside the house lies flat on the ground. The ground surrenders.

---

The father works late. The dead wife's hand makes fish-sticks while the boy sits in the corner where he fell. The fish in the fish-sticks think to themselves, This is not what we meant to be.

---

Its roots in the ground and its branches in the air, a tree is pulled in both directions.

---

The wife has a dead hand. This is earlier. She is living and her dead hand feeds her pills that don't work. The boy sleeps on the roof or falls out of trees. The father works late. The wife looks out the window and thinks, Not this.

---

The boy is a bird, bad bird. He falls out of trees.

---

She is living and her dead hand feeds her pills that don't work.

---

Let me tell you a story about war:
The fisherman's son serves drinks to sailors. he stands behind the bar. He listens closely for news of his dead brother. The sailors are thirsty. They drink rum. Tell me a story, says the fisherman's son.

---

There is nothing interesting about the sea. The water is flat, flat and calm, it seems a sheet of glass. You look at it, the more you look at it the more you feel like you are looking into your own head, which is a stranger's head, empty.

---

the more you look at it the more you feel like you are looking into your own head, which is a stranger's head, empty. We listen to the sound with our equipment. I have learned to understand this sound. When you look there is nothing, with the equipment there is sound.

---

We sit in rows and listen down the tunnels for the song. The song has red words in it. We write them down on sheets of paper and pass them along. Sometimes there is noise and sometimes song and often there is silence, the long tunnel, the sea like glass...

---

You are a translator, says the fisherman's son.
Yes, says the sailor.
And the sound is the voice of the enemy.
Yes, yes it is.

---

She had a soft voice and strong hands. When she sang she would seem too large for the room and she would play guitar and sing, which would make his chest feel huge. Sometimes he would touch her knee and smile. Sometimes she would touch his face and close her eyes.

---

The fisherman's son is a spy, a good one. Spies like documents. Spies wander and roam, scanning the information.

---

A man does work. A machine can, too. Power of agency, agent of what? This is a question we might ask.

---

What is a document before it's a document? A noise in your head, a backstory.
What makes a thing yours to steal or sell or trade? That is a question, good question.

---

Spies are pollinators. They take the bits from here and there to make a new thing grow. Does it matter to which team this new thing belongs?

---

Fox rounds the warren but there are no bunnies, jumps up with claws but there are no bunnies, moves down the road but there are no bunnies. There are no bunnies. He chases a bird instead. All wars are the same war. The bird flies away.

---

The fisherman's son knows nothing worth stealing. Perhaps, perhaps.
He once put a cat in a cardboard box, but she got out anyway. He once had a brother he lost to the sea. Brother, dead brother, who speaks to him in dreams. These are a few things worth saying.

---

He knows that when you snap a mast it's time to get a set of oars or learn how to breathe underwater. Rely on one thing too long and when it disappears and you have nothing—well, that's just bad planning. It's embarrassing, to think it could never happen. It happens.

---

You cannot get in the way of anyone's path to God. You can, but it does no good. Every spy knows this.

---

Some say God is where we put our sorrow. God says, Which one of you can get to me first?

---

The spies meet at the chain-link fence and tell each other stories. A whisper system, a level of honesty. To testify against yourself is an interesting thing, a sacrifice. Some people do it. Some people find money in the street, but you can't rely on it.

---

The fisherman's son is at the fence, waiting to see if he is useful.

---

You cannot get in the way of anyone's path to happiness, it also does no good. The problem is figuring out which part is the path and which part it the happiness.

---

It's a blessing: every day someone shows up at the fence. And when no one shows up, a different kind of blessing. In the wrong light anyone can look like a darkness.

---

In the wrong light anyone can look like a darkness.

---

There is something terribly wrong with his face—
empty, restless, one side older than the other.

---

What is a thing? Sediment. A slow river clogged with silt. I sussed the gesso into foam and white roses, stalling. I troubled the shadow and silvered his edges.

---

What can you know about a person? They shift in the light. You can't light up all sides at once. Add a second light and you get a second darkness, it's only fair.

---

He is looking at the wall and I am looking at his looking.

---

Difficult thing, to be scrutinized so long. I find the parts that overlap with mine and light them up in clays and creams, yellow music singing pink, the flicker of his mouth a purple rust.

---

His face congeals as he settles in. His hair is bronze in here, not gold: walnut, bark, and cinnamon, chipped brick tipped in ink. My shadow falls across his face, blue milk and pistachio, his eyes shine like wedding rings. My shadow falls across him and it doesn't go away.

---

Some hours later the light has shifted, the floorboards creak. You can't paint the inside of anything, so why would you try? Painting the inside of anything is dangerous.

---

You can't paint the inside of anything, so why would you try? Painting the inside of anything is dangerous. I imagined my wrists broken just enough to keep the feeling from crawling up my arm. Dangerous thing: an open arm, an open channel. All these things, rungs of the ladder.

---

It's rude to shake a man visible and claim the results. This side of his face, now this side of his face. His profile up against the tulips. I put down the brush and walked around the room.

---

Lovers do the looking while the strangers look away. It isn't fair, the depth of my looking, the threat of my looking.

---

Even when I look away I am still looking. He is inside his body and I am inside my body and it matters less and less.

---

Shared face, shared looking. A collaboration. He didn't expect to be handed over, to be delivered. To be tricked into his own face.

---

Anyone can paint a mask. It's boring. And everyone secretly wants to collaborate with the enemy, to construct a truer version of the self. How much can you change and get away with it, before you turn into something else, before it's some kind of murder?

---

Difficult, to be confronted with the fact of yourself. Opaque in the sense of finally solid, in the sense of see me, not through me. The selves, glaze on glaze, accumulating their moods and minutes.

---

We tremble and I paint the trembling. I enlarged his mouth and everything went blurry, a forgery. It might as well be. And all my fingers turned to twigs.

---

Inside himself he jumped a little. Why build a room you can live in? Why build a shed for your fears? The life of a body is a nightmare.

---

This is my hand over his face, which isn't his face anymore, revising. I made a shape of the shape he made, subtracted what he shared with anyone else. There wasn't much left but it felt like him, wild and scared. It was too much to bear.

---

There wasn't much left but it felt like him, wild and scared. It was too much to bear. I put down the brush and looked at my hands. I turned off the headlights of my looking and let the animal get away.

---

When she saw herself, finished, she said It doesn't look like me. Picasso said, It will. Perhaps it will look like her because it is the document and will remain, while she is just a person who will fade. Now, when we think of her, we think of this painting.

---

The painting is evidence but not proof. There's no proof that she looked like that, even though we have the document. She existed enough to be painted. She could have been an idea, but that's another kind of existing.

---

The hand is a tool. The brush is a tool. The paint as well. There is no machine here, though the work gets done.

---

A lever is a machine, has a fulcrum which can be moved to change the ratio of something or other, effort for distance. There is a fulcrum in the mind that can be moved as well. I do not know what else to say about this.

---

It's hard to talk about what you believe while you are believing it. Fervor reduces thought to shorthand and all we get is an icon. Give a man a weapon and you have a warrior. Put him on a horse and you have a hero. The weapon is a tool. The horse is a metaphor.

---

Raphael painted this twice—white horse facing east against the greens, white horse facing west against the yellows. The maiden flees or prays, depending. A basic dragon, the kind you'd expect from the Renaissance. Evidence of evil but not proof.

---

There's a companion piece as well: Saint Michael. Paint angels, it's easier: you don't need the horse. Michael stands on Satan's throat, vanquishing, while everything brown burns red. All these things happened. Allegedly.

---

When you paint an evil thing, do you invoke it or take away its power?

---

This could be the definition of painting. The best part of spirituality is reverence. There are other parts. Some people like to hear the sound of their own voice. If you don't believe in the world it would be stupid to paint it.

---

The best part of spirituality is reverence. There are other parts. Some people like to hear the sound of their own voice. If you don't believe in the world it would be stupid to paint it. If you don't believe in God, then who are you talking to?

---

Wanted for murder, a price on his head, Caravaggio does what he always does—he tries to paint his way out of it.

---

This bad boy—whose moodiness came to be called the Baroque, this thug whose soul was as big as Rome and full of anvils—paints his own face on Goliath's severed head and offers himself up as a villain, captured, to escape the hammers of the law.

---

Allegory, yes. A truth as well. But truth doesn't count in law, only proof.

---

He took the gods and made them human.

---

His Bacchus was a worn-out drunk. An animal likely to sleep in a pool of its own sick.

---

He raised the status of the still life, made subjects out of objects, turned nature into drama—the bloom on the grapes, the bloom on the boys, leaves as important as nudes.

---

Exaggerated light, pure theater. Evidence of a mind he delights in. Evicted from Rome, he wants back in. They want his head and he's prepared to give it to them.

---

His painted head arrives in Rome weeks later. All painting is sent downstream, into the future.

---

Contrast and likeness, the difference between
one bird and many. The similarity of one bird, one
worm, one stone. From finger-counting to sticks,
to symbols, to abstractions: magnitudes no longer
represented by pebbles.

---

Numbers larger than ten
are no longer human: they fly from the hand into
the imaginary sky we call hypothesis.

---

Take this bird, for example: make it equal something. Get it on
one side of the sky. Solve means isolate. Solve means
conquer. The numbers suit up and take the field.

---

Was I discovered or invented? asks the zero. Feels like
I've always been here. I put a line around his border
but he still wasn't there. A hole in the world. A failure.
I turned away.

---

You start counting at one, not zero,
which is wrong, says the moon. Thing or nothing,
where or nowhere. Measure yourself against the truth and
not the other way around, says the ghost.

---

Man, moon, ghost, zero — naming rounds off. Perfect and completely dead.

---

Your math is crazy, says the moon.
You can count to eight with the spaces between your
fingers, says the ghost. If you have one apples and
I take away one apples you have, zero apples and a sadness,
says the sadness.

---

Counting is boring even when it works, says
the square root of negative one. Subtraction is worse, says
the ghost while the sadness nods his head. Math is just
replacing things with other things, says the moon.

---

Math is just replacing things with other things, says the moon.
Skull on a bottle equals poison, says the moon. We erase
birds from the sky in an attempt to solve for, we put
bodies in piles in an attempt to solve for, says the ghost.

---

People don't learn anything unless they are afraid of
being left behind, says the suitcase. I am afraid, says the suitcase.

---

Here and there and what to do about it. Leave
out the equal sign and the very idea of a place will end,
says the equal sign. Even when you are in rocketships.

---

Black ice in moonlight. A spiritual algebra. Zero zero
zero roses. And I am not the moon, says the moon.
I am your own big stupid head just trying to talk to you.
A hole in the sky and we call it the moon. You are bound
to have many questions now. Try to formulate them.

---

A clock is a machine. A gear is a tool. There is rarely any joy in a frictionless place, so find your inner viscosity.

---

The mind says viscosity is resistance to flow. The body
puts glue on a twig and catches a bird. Glue is a tool,
unless you are a bird. If you are a bird, then glue is
an inconvenience. A tool does work. A bird flies away
from danger and lands where it can.

---

All thinking is comparison. A bear is a weapon, a bear claw is a pastry.
A bear trap, if you are a bear, is an inconvenience.
Logic is boring because it works. Being unreasonable is exciting.
Machines have knobs you can turn if you want to.

---

A hammer is a hammer when it hits the nail. A hammer is not a hammer when it is sleeping. I woke up tired of being the hammer.

---

There's a dream in the space between the hammer and the nail: the dream of about-to-be-hit, which is a bad dream, but the nail will take the hit if it gets to sleep inside the wood forever. I taped a sword to my hand when I was younger. This is an argument about goals.

---

I am the wind and the wind is invisible, all the leaves
tremble but I am invisible, bloom without flower, knot
without rope, song without throat in wingless flight, dark
boat in the dark night, pure velocity.

---

As the hammer is a hammer when it hits the nail, and the nail is a nail when
it meets the wood, and the invisible table begins to appear
out of mind, pure mind, out of nothing, pure thinking.

---

Through darkness, through silence, a vector a violence,
I labor, I lumber, I fumble forward through the valley as
winter, as water, I mist and frost, flexible and elastic to
the task.

---

I am the hand that lifts the rock, I am the mind
that strings the worm and throws the line and feels the tug,
the flex in the pole, and foot by foot I find the groove,
the trace in the thicket, the key in the lock, as root breaks
rock, from seed to flower to fruit to rot

---

I track, I follow, I hinge and turn, frictionless and efficient as an equal sign. I flip and fold, I superimpose, I become location and you veer toward me, the eye to which you are relative, magnetized for your revelation.

---

Hook and bait, polestar and checkmate, I am your arrival, there is no refusal, we are here, you see, together, we are already here.

---

A man found a door and hung it on the wall.
I think he thought in rectangles, each day's bright panel pushed one against the next, a calendar of light. He would paint them, all these days and hang them out of order:

---

I think he thought in rectangles, each day's bright panel pushed one against the next, a calendar of light. He would paint them, all these days and hang them out of order: an unreliable hotel where no one ever knew which rooms were his, which rooms he had actually been inside of.

---

There were gaps, of course, and sometimes overlaps: days too small to fill  their slots, days too large for the day to hold them. And days, no matter what their size, that leaked into the next. A leaky day is a dangerous thing. January and her thirty-two rooms.

---

A leaky day is a dangerous thing. January and her thirty-two rooms.

---

I put my sadness in a box. The box went soft and wet and weak at the bottom. I
called it Thursday. Today is Sunday. The town is empty.
I stood in the road looking forward and back, to see if it would change something.
After a while, I went back inside and tripped over the box.

---

I put my sadness in a box. The box went soft and wet and weak at the bottom. I called it Thursday.

---

Hard to say, even now, what it was, this extra room. He put his foot in the door of it, kept it open. He painted himself and others appeared. He painted his hunger and suddenly table, the soup fully illustrated in the depth of its bowl.

---

He used the wrong colors to make it right, selecting them for what they felt not what they said, so that everything became a set of relations outside the realm of simple minutes and their names accumulations. Bruising Day, The Month of Pears, The Year of Infestations.

---

Today is Monday. The box is still leaking. Now it is Tuesday.

---

The walls were strong, the nails: reliable. The room grew darker or lighter than it should have been, given the placement of the lamps; the hands of his hands alluding to a secret world beyond the frame he shouldn't have any knowledge of.

---

What's better than a thought? A method. And a hallway appears because you are looking for it.

---

Each day another panel to lather the paint on, to hide the stone in. Where to place the stone? Inside today, inside tomorrow. Is it the frame that makes it dangerous? There are frames around everything already.

---

The directors agreed. The crates arrived. They added the pieces to the collection and the whole museum shifted. You have to understand it as it is. Shining blue, shining green. This is also part of the story: how the story changes. This is something I forgot to tell you.

---

This is also part of the story: how the story changes. This is something I forgot to tell you.

---

I looked at the pears. I painted the pears, what they were like. I waited for the pears to reveal their mystery. Five brown pears in a chipped white bowl, soft and scarred and blushing yellow in the throbbing dark. They shine in their suits.

---

Five brown pears in a chipped white bowl, soft and scarred and blushing yellow in the throbbing dark. They shine in their suits. I hung them on the wall. Precise. A landmark. You might like it here. I think that you might like it here.

---

I erased my legs and forgot to draw in the stilts.
It looks like I’m floating but I’m not floating.
Sometimes I draw you with fangs. I tell you these things because I love you.

---

Some people paint
with whiskey and call it social drinking. Some people
paint drunk and put dots of color everywhere.
In the morning the dots make them happy. I am
putting dots of color everywhere and you are sleeping.

---

Something has happened in the paint tonight and
it is worth keeping. It’s nothing like I thought it
would be and closer to what I meant.

---

None of it is real, darling. I say it to you. Maybe we will wake up
singing. Maybe we will wake up to the silence
of shoes at the foot of the bed not going anywhere.

---

Two lovers went to a museum and wandered the rooms. He saw a painting and stood in front of it for too long. It was a few minutes before she realized he had gotten stuck. He was stuck looking at a painting.

---

She stood next to him, looking at his face and then the face in the painting. What do you see? she asked. I don't know, he said. He didn't know.

---

She was disappointed, then bored. He was looking at a face and she was looking at her watch.

---

He was looking at a face and she was looking at her watch.
This is where everything changed. There was now
a distance between them. He was looking at a face
but it might as well have been a cabbage or a
sugar beet. Perhaps it was something about yellow
near pink.

---

He didn't know how to say it. Years later
he still didn't know how to say it, and she was gone.

---

Once there was a deer called stag. A white breasted, a many pointed. He refused to still when he halted, the hooves in his mind were always lifted. Everything comes close, the branches slide.

---

In a clearing made of cleavings, stag sees another stag.
They watch each other, they share no story. I will not cross you and you must move
on. There is nothing else. It reminds me of some tale, stay with me to remember, it
reminds me of where I was going without you.

---

The hunter sinks his arrows into the trees and then paints the targets around them. The trees imagine they are deer. The deer imagine they are safe. The arrows: they have no imagination.
All night the wind blows through the trees. It makes a sound.

---

The hunter’s son watches the hunter. The hunter paints more rings on his glasses. Everything is a target, says the hunter. No matter where you look. The hunter’s son says nothing, and closes his eyes.

---

The hunter’s son watches the stag.
Clench is a hand word. His hand is clenched. Door with a bad hinge, it wouldn’t open. Do not let go of the arrow, let it slip through your fingers as you relax your grip. This is good advice. He couldn’t do it.

---

Do not let go of the arrow, let it slip through your fingers as you relax your grip.
This is good advice. He couldn’t do it. There is no way to get to the future from here.

---

The key to archery is sustained attention. An arrow is a stick with feathers, an extension of the mind. Men and their thoughts, their quivers and their arrows: it helps to see how these things move, and where they land.
The stag watches the hunter’s son.

---

This is a story of loops, at least one. I stepped off the loop. I spent time listening, testing realms. I snapped a twig in my head and struck out.

---

You know what it’s like to be alone: gimlets and vermicide. You know what it’s like to be alive, so forgiveness.

---

All night the trees stand silent in the dark, not touching.
I put on the deer suit. I turned my ears in all directions. I’ll live alone or in between. This is the testimony of the deer: solitude, the long corridors, love from a distance.

---

I’ll live alone or in between. This is the testimony of the deer: solitude, the long corridors, love from a distance. You asked me once, What are we made of? Well, these are the things we’re made of. One house, two house. The road goes away from here.

---

I looked at all the trees and didn’t know what to do.
A box made out of leaves.
What else was in the woods? A heart, closing. Nevertheless.
Everyone needs a place. It shouldn’t be inside of someone else.

---

Everyone needs a place. It shouldn’t be inside of someone else.

---

I kept my mind on the moon. Cold moon, long nights moon.
From the landscape: a sense of scale.
From the dead: a sense of scale.
I turned my back on the story. A sense of superiority.
Everything casts a shadow.
Your body told me in a dream it’s never been afraid of anything.

---

A door had been opened and could not be shut and then
it was shut. I turned my back and felt the vacuum of my leaving.

---

I live in big spaces, so I'm left alone in big spaces.
Thinking in the language of the enemy. Moving through
the landscape of the enemy.

---

We were spies and the confidants
of spies, pockets and telephones, gathering evidence without
leaving any. Spies feel like they know something important.
It is a feeling. Opulent. Grand.

---

We invented a fence in the middle of the snow so we could meet at the fence and whisper. Clemency at the fence. These small repeated revelations stabilize something. Faith in snow, bravery in snow. A daily maintenance.

---

Is this your sadness? asks the trashman. No, that
is a fishbone and that is a soup can and that over there is no
longer recognizable.

---

Paint ghosts over everything, the sadness
of everything. We made ourselves cold. We made ourselves
snow. We smuggled ourselves into ourselves. Haunted by
each other's knowledge. To hide somewhere is not surrender,
it is trickery. All day the snow falls down, all night the snow.

---

To hide somewhere is not surrender,
it is trickery. All day the snow falls down, all night the snow.
I try to guess your trajectory and end up telling my own story.
We left footprints in the slush of ourselves, getting out of there.

---

Close the blinds and kill the birds, I surrender
my desire for a logical culmination. I surrender my
desire to be healed.

---

The blurriness of being alive.
Take it or leave it, and for the most part you take it.
Not just the idea of it but the ramifications of it.
People love to hate themselves, avoiding the
necessary recalibrations.

---

Shame comes from vanity.
Shame means you're guilty, like the rest of us,
but you think you're better than we are. Maybe you are.

---

What would a better me paint? There is no new me, there is no old me, there's just me, the same me, the whole time.

---

Vanity, vanity, forcing your will on the world.
Don't try to make a stronger wind,
you'll wear yourself out. Build a better sail. You
want to solve something? Get out of your own way.

---

What's the difference between me and the world?
Compartmentalization. The world doesn't know
what to do with my love. Because it isn't used to
being loved. It's a framework problem. Disheartening?
Obviously. I hope it's love. I'm trying really hard
to make it love.

---

I hope it's love. I'm trying really hard to make it love.

---

I said no more severity. I said it severely
and slept through all my appointments.

---

I clawed my way into the light but the light is just as scary.
I'd rather quit. I'd rather be sad. It's too much work.

---

I clawed
my way into the light but the light is just as scary.
I'd rather quit. I'd rather be sad. It's too much work.
Admirable? Not really. I hate my friends. And when
I hate my friends I've failed myself, failed to share
my compassion.

---

Admirable? Not really. I hate my friends. And when
I hate my friends I've failed myself, failed to share
my compassion. I shine a light on them of my own
making: septic, ugly, the wrong yellow. I mean, maybe
it's better if my opponent wins.

---

I shine a light on them of my own
making: septic, ugly, the wrong yellow. I mean, maybe
it's better if my opponent wins.

---

I stepped out so things could progress without me.
The knot of the self; take it out. The knot of the self:
what is the rope? The ability to nullify the self
in favor of the landscape, or a lover, or a bowl of fruit.
What happens when I no longer want to meet you?

---

What happens when I no longer want to meet you?
Something interesting. A legitimate answer, but
it leaves a hole. Nothing lasts forever: we know this.
Looking changes the looker: we know this. It's easier
to talk about one thing at a time: I know, I know.

---

Mortal love? Sure. Lovers abandoned and desperate?
Sure. Longing and suffering? Of course, of course.
You want it to mean something.

---

Mortal love? Sure. Lovers abandoned and desperate?
Sure. Longing and suffering? Of course, of course.
You want it to mean something. Sad pink cakes.
Five strange blue things. You want to have it glued
together. The days were short and the halls were long.
Something like that.

---

Crawled up the pleat of my coat:
a shadow did. Shut the basement door: a ghost did.
It accumulates. Grounding the abstract offers several
pleasures: certainly. Love, maybe love, maybe
bathtub: certainly.

---

Grabbing the throat of it: that's
what we always do. You can disconnect it or you can
try to glue it all together. He could glue it all together.
I could. Who's speaking anyway? Not really a problem,
says the moon. Since y'all look the same from up here.

---

We could pull it apart, spend our whole lives pulling it apart and have no time left to do anything smart with the pieces.

---

The wrong things have been wired
together. Things that shouldn't touch. The sooner
you embrace it, the sooner it will leave you.

---

The sooner you embrace it, the sooner it will leave you. Okay.
The bruise: milk yellow. You are what you cover up.
Okay, okay. These damages are connected. I glued
more pictures to it: doctored, rigged, unverifiable.

---

There were boxes in my head and I moved them
around, pretended it changed something.
It didn't work. I plugged my cord to see
what kind of a lamp I was. It didn't matter.

---

What is a ghost? What is a painting? Yes and yes,
the same answers. My mind wanted a reward, so
it filled in all the gaps it found, smoothed it all out.

---

I lost the important parts and I set about restoring.
Wanting to show and not being able. Sometimes
the wing of the bird and sometimes the bird trying to fly.

---

Put yourself in the painting:
you are responsible. Broadcast from a smeary place:
you are responsible. Wearing your dead face,
your man face, your real face: you are responsible.

---

Clomp clomp down the mines of thinking—
the compromise: where the thought wants to go
and where you want it to go.

---

Truth is relative
to the model: big deal. Mathematicians extend
the natural language: big deal. Precision is necessary
so we can know what we are investigating. Yes, yes:
show me. What holds it together?

---

Yes, yes: show me. What holds it together? Glue, some kind of glue. The image remains as a body would. I turned the image over like a rock, but then the worms.

---

It is too heavy, says the canvas. You lack restraint.

I was sleeping in whiteness, drifts of snow,
and you woke me and told me your dream, my blank
face upturned, listening. You came to me while we
were sleeping, we were both sleeping, and you asked me
to hold this for you.

Once, night, unchallenged, extended its dark grace
across the sky. To the credit of the town, the stars
at night had been enough

---

Eventually, three brothers, traveling through
a foreign town, found an evening that did not
disappear behind the mountains, for a shining globe
sat in an oak tree. The brothers stopped. That one
is the moon, said a man from the foreign town.

---

The brothers stole the moon down and put it
in their wagon. Seized it. Thieved its silver. Altogether
greedy. The wagon shining brights. At home:
the moon delivered. Then, celebration: dancing in red
coats on the meadow. Number four brother smiling wide.

---

The moon installed—it extended its silver
calculations. Time and more time. The brothers aged,
took sick, petitioned the town that each quarter
of the moon, as it was their property, be portioned out
to share their graves. Done, and the light of the moon
diminished in fractions.

---

Done, and the light of the moon
diminished in fractions. They had extinguished it,
part for part, and night, unimpeded, fell. Altogether
lanternless. The people were silent. The dark rang loud.
Underground: cold blazing.

---

The dead woke, shivering
in the light. Some went out to play and dance,
others hastened to the taverns to drink, quarrel,
and brawl. Noise and more noise. Noise up to heaven.

---

Noise and more noise. Noise up to heaven.
Saint Peter took his red horse through the gates
and came down. The moon, for the third time, taken.

---

The dead bidden back into their graves. One wonders
why a story like this exists.

---

The holes in this story are not lamps, they are not wheels. I walked and walked, grew a beard so I could drag it in the dirt, into a forest that wasn't there. I want to give you more but not everything. You don't need everything.

---

This is what they found on the dead man's desk when the landlord let them in: twenty-eight pages, esoteric and unfollowable, written with perfect penmanship and a total disregard for any reader, as if the intended audience was a population not quite human.

---

Angelic script, says the detective, lifting the pages, feeling their heft and he wonders what he means because it isn't. His partner nods but ignores him.

---

A park bench, white roses, dark coats and white roses, snow and repetitions of snow—it's hard to read but pretty much how they found him: dead on a bench in a black coat, the snow falling down.

---

it's hard to read but pretty much how they found him: dead on a bench in a black coat, the snow falling down.
Twigs and blackbirds, snow and red horses, the ghosts floating up, the snow falling down—the detective is weeping—and the black coat.

---

Someone has to leave first. This is a very old story. There is no other version of this story.

---

It's getting late, Little Moon. Finish the song.
It's not that late.
You are my moon, Little Moon, and it's late enough. So climb down out of the tree.
Is it safe?
Safe enough.
Are you dead as well?

---

Are you dead as well?
The night is cold, it is silver, it is a coin.
Not everyone is dead, Little Moon. But the big moon needs the tree.
There is a ghost at the end of the song.
Yes, there is. And you see his hand and then you see the moon.
Am I the ghost at the end of the song?

---

Not everyone is dead, Little Moon. But the big moon needs the tree.

Yes, there is. And you see his hand and then you see the moon.
Am I the ghost at the end of the song?
We are very close now, Little Moon. Thank you for shining on me.

---

We are very close now, Little Moon. Thank you for shining on me.

---

He was pointing at the moon but I was looking at his hand. He was dead anyway, a ghost. I'm surprised I saw his hand at all.

---

He was pointing at the moon but I was looking at his hand. He was dead anyway, a ghost. I'm surprised I saw his hand at all. All this was prepared for me. All this was set in motion a long time ago. I live in someone else's future.

---

All this was prepared for me. All this was set in motion a long time ago. I live in someone else's future.
I stayed as long as I could, he said. Now look at the moon.

---

I stayed as long as I could, he said. Now look at the moon.

The central panel now missing—
We all dream of the complete document, the atlas of the idea,
the fish on the table finally gutted—
What does all this love amount to?
Putting down the brush for the last time—
